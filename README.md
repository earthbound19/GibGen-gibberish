# GibGen-gibberish

Tools to create nonsense from sense; recombobulators.

See the [README.md](gibGenPython/README.md) in ./gibGenPython to get started (it will point you to other things to read).

At this writing this repository includes other (undocumented?) tools and scripts useful for preparing corpuses to generate gibberish.

This repository may eventaully host source code for various recombobulators I have coded and/or ganked over the years.
