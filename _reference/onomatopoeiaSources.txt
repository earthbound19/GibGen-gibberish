so much to be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia#External_links : 
collecting from: http://www.writtensound.com/index.php?term=a -- have collected up to c, BUT: --hmm! It seems a query with any two letters and a dash, like http://www.writtensound.com/index.php?term=a-z -- will display all entries? -- so I've filtered all entries from such display and will do a statistics check on whether any random word I pick from any random letter-page is in the result list. If ten of them in a row are, I'll call it good.

as yet untapped:
