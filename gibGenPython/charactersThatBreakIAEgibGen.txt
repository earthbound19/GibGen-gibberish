This is probably from a bug I've anticipated; these may break gibgen from the IAE.mkvch file in cases where there is no matching starting letter to find in the db; in such cases a new starting character should be randomly drawn. Some of these look like ASCII characters but are not; done adding to this list until I fix that case (and see if the bug continues) . .

I believe this is where it repeatedly picks and prints 'А' from the above list. It seems maybe I can check for this condition where the random number range available is 0,0 per the log there.
