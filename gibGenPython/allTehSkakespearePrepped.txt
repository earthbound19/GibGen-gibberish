the sonnets by william shakespeare from fairest creatures we desire increase that thereby beauty's rose might never die but as the riper should by time decease his tender heir might bear his memory but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel making a famine where abundance lies thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel thou that art now the world's fresh ornament and only herald to the gaudy spring within thine own bud buriest thy content and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding pity the world or else this glutton be to eat the world's due by the grave and thee when forty winters shall besiege thy brow and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now will be a tattered weed of small worth held then being asked where all thy beauty lies where all the treasure of thy lusty days to say within thine own deep sunken eyes were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine shall sum my count and make my old excuse' proving his beauty by succession thine this were to be new made when thou art old and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest now is the time that face should form another whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother for where is she so fair whose uneared womb disdains the tillage of thy husbandry or who is he so fond will be the tomb of his self-love to stop posterity thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime so thou through windows of thine age shalt see despite of wrinkles this thy golden time but if thou live remembered not to be die single and thine image dies with thee unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend upon thy self thy beauty's legacy nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend and being frank she lends to those are free then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse the bounteous largess given thee to give profitless usurer why dost thou use so great a sum of sums yet canst not live for having traffic with thy self alone thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive then how when nature calls thee to be gone what acceptable audit canst thou leave thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee which used lives th' executor to be those hours that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell will play the tyrants to the very same and that unfair which fairly doth excel for never-resting time leads summer on to hideous winter and confounds him there sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where then were not summer's distillation left a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass beauty's effect with beauty were bereft nor it nor no remembrance what it was but flowers distilled though they with winter meet leese but their show their substance still lives sweet then let not winter's ragged hand deface in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled make sweet some vial treasure thou some place with beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed that use is not forbidden usury which happies those that pay the willing loan that's for thy self to breed another thee or ten times happier be it ten for one ten times thy self were happier than thou art if ten of thine ten times refigured thee then what could death do if thou shouldst depart leaving thee living in posterity be not self-willed for thou art much too fair to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir lo in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his burning head each under eye doth homage to his new-appearing sight serving with looks his sacred majesty and having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill resembling strong youth in his middle age yet mortal looks adore his beauty still attending on his golden pilgrimage but when from highmost pitch with weary car like feeble age he reeleth from the day the eyes fore duteous now converted are from his low tract and look another way so thou thy self out-going in thy noon unlooked on diest unless thou get a son music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy if the true concord of well-tuned sounds by unions married do offend thine ear they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear mark how one string sweet husband to another strikes each in each by mutual ordering resembling sire and child and happy mother who all in one one pleasing note do sing whose speechless song being many seeming one sings this to thee 'thou single wilt prove none' is it for fear to wet a widow's eye that thou consum'st thy self in single life ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die the world will wail thee like a makeless wife the world will be thy widow and still weep that thou no form of thee hast left behind when every private widow well may keep by children's eyes her husband's shape in mind look what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it but beauty's waste hath in the world an end and kept unused the user so destroys it no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murd'rous shame commits for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any who for thy self art so unprovident grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many but that thou none lov'st is most evident for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire o change thy thought that i may change my mind shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love be as thy presence is gracious and kind or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove make thee another self for love of me that beauty still may live in thine or thee as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st in one of thine from that which thou departest and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest herein lives wisdom beauty and increase without this folly age and cold decay if all were minded so the times should cease and threescore year would make the world away let those whom nature hath not made for store harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish look whom she best endowed she gave thee more which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby thou shouldst print more not let that copy die when i do count the clock that tells the time and see the brave day sunk in hideous night when i behold the violet past prime and sable curls all silvered o'er with white when lofty trees i see barren of leaves which erst from heat did canopy the herd and summer's green all girded up in sheaves borne on the bier with white and bristly beard then of thy beauty do i question make that thou among the wastes of time must go since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake and die as fast as they see others grow and nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence o that you were your self but love you are no longer yours than you your self here live against this coming end you should prepare and your sweet semblance to some other give so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination then you were your self again after your self's decease when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear who lets so fair a house fall to decay which husbandry in honour might uphold against the stormy gusts of winter's day and barren rage of death's eternal cold o none but unthrifts dear my love you know you had a father let your son say so not from the stars do i my judgement pluck and yet methinks i have astronomy but not to tell of good or evil luck of plagues of dearths or seasons' quality nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell pointing to each his thunder rain and wind or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive and constant stars in them i read such art as truth and beauty shall together thrive if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert or else of thee this i prognosticate thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment when i perceive that men as plants increase cheered and checked even by the self-same sky vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease and wear their brave state out of memory then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night and all in war with time for love of you as he takes from you i engraft you new but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant time and fortify your self in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme now stand you on the top of happy hours and many maiden gardens yet unset with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers much liker than your painted counterfeit so should the lines of life that life repair which this time's pencil or my pupil pen neither in inward worth nor outward fair can make you live your self in eyes of men to give away your self keeps your self still and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill who will believe my verse in time to come if it were filled with your most high deserts though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life and shows not half your parts if i could write the beauty of your eyes and in fresh numbers number all your graces the age to come would say this poet lies such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces so should my papers yellowed with their age be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue and your true rights be termed a poet's rage and stretched metre of an antique song but were some child of yours alive that time you should live twice in it and in my rhyme shall i compare thee to a summer's day thou art more lovely and more temperate rough winds do shake the darling buds of may and summer's lease hath all too short a date sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines and often is his gold complexion dimmed and every fair from fair sometime declines by chance or nature's changing course untrimmed but thy eternal summer shall not fade nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st so long as men can breathe or eyes can see so long lives this and this gives life to thee devouring time blunt thou the lion's paws and make the earth devour her own sweet brood pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws and burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st and do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed time to the wide world and all her fading sweets but i forbid thee one most heinous crime o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen him in thy course untainted do allow for beauty's pattern to succeeding men yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong my love shall in my verse ever live young a woman's face with nature's own hand painted hast thou the master mistress of my passion a woman's gentle heart but not acquainted with shifting change as is false women's fashion an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling gilding the object whereupon it gazeth a man in hue all hues in his controlling which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth and for a woman wert thou first created till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting and by addition me of thee defeated by adding one thing to my purpose nothing but since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure so is it not with me as with that muse stirred by a painted beauty to his verse who heaven it self for ornament doth use and every fair with his fair doth rehearse making a couplement of proud compare with sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems with april's first-born flowers and all things rare that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems o let me true in love but truly write and then believe me my love is as fair as any mother's child though not so bright as those gold candles fixed in heaven's air let them say more that like of hearsay well i will not praise that purpose not to sell my glass shall not persuade me i am old so long as youth and thou are of one date but when in thee time's furrows i behold then look i death my days should expiate for all that beauty that doth cover thee is but the seemly raiment of my heart which in thy breast doth live as thine in me how can i then be elder than thou art o therefore love be of thyself so wary as i not for my self but for thee will bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill presume not on thy heart when mine is slain thou gav'st me thine not to give back again as an unperfect actor on the stage who with his fear is put beside his part or some fierce thing replete with too much rage whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart so i for fear of trust forget to say the perfect ceremony of love's rite and in mine own love's strength seem to decay o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might o let my looks be then the eloquence and dumb presagers of my speaking breast who plead for love and look for recompense more than that tongue that more hath more expressed o learn to read what silent love hath writ to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled thy beauty's form in table of my heart my body is the frame wherein 'tis held and perspective it is best painter's art for through the painter must you see his skill to find where your true image pictured lies which in my bosom's shop is hanging still that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me are windows to my breast where-through the sun delights to peep to gaze therein on thee yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art they draw but what they see know not the heart let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars unlooked for joy in that i honour most great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the sun's eye and in themselves their pride lies buried for at a frown they in their glory die the painful warrior famoused for fight after a thousand victories once foiled is from the book of honour razed quite and all the rest forgot for which he toiled then happy i that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed lord of my love to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit to thee i send this written embassage to witness duty not to show my wit duty so great which wit so poor as mine may make seem bare in wanting words to show it but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy soul's thought all naked will bestow it till whatsoever star that guides my moving points on me graciously with fair aspect and puts apparel on my tattered loving to show me worthy of thy sweet respect then may i dare to boast how i do love thee till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me weary with toil i haste me to my bed the dear respose for limbs with travel tired but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind when body's work's expired for then my thoughts from far where i abide intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee and keep my drooping eyelids open wide looking on darkness which the blind do see save that my soul's imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view which like a jewel hung in ghastly night makes black night beauteous and her old face new lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind for thee and for my self no quiet find how can i then return in happy plight that am debarred the benefit of rest when day's oppression is not eased by night but day by night and night by day oppressed and each though enemies to either's reign do in consent shake hands to torture me the one by toil the other to complain how far i toil still farther off from thee i tell the day to please him thou art bright and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven so flatter i the swart-complexioned night when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer and night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries and look upon my self and curse my fate wishing me like to one more rich in hope featured like him like him with friends possessed desiring this man's art and that man's scope with what i most enjoy contented least yet in these thoughts my self almost despising haply i think on thee and then my state like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings that then i scorn to change my state with kings when to the sessions of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of things past i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste then can i drown an eye unused to flow for precious friends hid in death's dateless night and weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe and moan th' expense of many a vanished sight then can i grieve at grievances foregone and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er the sad account of fore-bemoaned moan which i new pay as if not paid before but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restored and sorrows end thy bosom is endeared with all hearts which i by lacking have supposed dead and there reigns love and all love's loving parts and all those friends which i thought buried how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye as interest of the dead which now appear but things removed that hidden in thee lie thou art the grave where buried love doth live hung with the trophies of my lovers gone who all their parts of me to thee did give that due of many now is thine alone their images i loved i view in thee and thou all they hast all the all of me if thou survive my well-contented day when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more re-survey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover compare them with the bett'ring of the time and though they be outstripped by every pen reserve them for my love not for their rhyme exceeded by the height of happier men o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought 'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage but since he died and poets better prove theirs for their style i'll read his for his love' full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye kissing with golden face the meadows green gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace even so my sun one early morn did shine with all triumphant splendour on my brow but out alack he was but one hour mine the region cloud hath masked him from me now yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth why didst thou promise such a beauteous day and make me travel forth without my cloak to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke 'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break to dry the rain on my storm-beaten face for no man well of such a salve can speak that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace nor can thy shame give physic to my grief though thou repent yet i have still the loss th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offence's cross ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds no more be grieved at that which thou hast done roses have thorns and silver fountains mud clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud all men make faults and even i in this authorizing thy trespass with compare my self corrupting salving thy amiss excusing thy sins more than thy sins are for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense thy adverse party is thy advocate and 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence such civil war is in my love and hate that i an accessary needs must be to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me let me confess that we two must be twain although our undivided loves are one so shall those blots that do with me remain without thy help by me be borne alone in our two loves there is but one respect though in our lives a separable spite which though it alter not love's sole effect yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight i may not evermore acknowledge thee lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame nor thou with public kindness honour me unless thou take that honour from thy name but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report as a decrepit father takes delight to see his active child do deeds of youth so i made lame by fortune's dearest spite take all my comfort of thy worth and truth for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit or any of these all or all or more entitled in thy parts do crowned sit i make my love engrafted to this store so then i am not lame poor nor despised whilst that this shadow doth such substance give that i in thy abundance am sufficed and by a part of all thy glory live look what is best that best i wish in thee this wish i have then ten times happy me how can my muse want subject to invent while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse thine own sweet argument too excellent for every vulgar paper to rehearse o give thy self the thanks if aught in me worthy perusal stand against thy sight for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee when thou thy self dost give invention light be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate and he that calls on thee let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date if my slight muse do please these curious days the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise o how thy worth with manners may i sing when thou art all the better part of me what can mine own praise to mine own self bring and what is't but mine own when i praise thee even for this let us divided live and our dear love lose name of single one that by this separation i may give that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave to entertain the time with thoughts of love which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive and that thou teachest how to make one twain by praising him here who doth hence remain take all my loves my love yea take them all what hast thou then more than thou hadst before no love my love that thou mayst true love call all mine was thine before thou hadst this more then if for my love thou my love receivest i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thy self refusest i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief although thou steal thee all my poverty and yet love knows it is a greater grief to bear greater wrong than hate's known injury lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows kill me with spites yet we must not be foes those pretty wrongs that liberty commits when i am sometime absent from thy heart thy beauty and thy years full well befits for still temptation follows where thou art gentle thou art and therefore to be won beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed and when a woman woos what woman's son will sourly leave her till he have prevailed ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee thine by thy beauty being false to me that thou hast her it is not all my grief and yet it may be said i loved her dearly that she hath thee is of my wailing chief a loss in love that touches me more nearly loving offenders thus i will excuse ye thou dost love her because thou know'st i love her and for my sake even so doth she abuse me suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her if i lose thee my loss is my love's gain and losing her my friend hath found that loss both find each other and i lose both twain and both for my sake lay on me this cross but here's the joy my friend and i are one sweet flattery then she loves but me alone when most i wink then do mine eyes best see for all the day they view things unrespected but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee and darkly bright are bright in dark directed then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright how would thy shadow's form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so how would i say mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay all days are nights to see till i see thee and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me if the dull substance of my flesh were thought injurious distance should not stop my way for then despite of space i would be brought from limits far remote where thou dost stay no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removed from thee for nimble thought can jump both sea and land as soon as think the place where he would be but ah thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend time's leisure with my moan receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears badges of either's woe the other two slight air and purging fire are both with thee wherever i abide the first my thought the other my desire these present-absent with swift motion slide for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee my life being made of four with two alone sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy until life's composition be recured by those swift messengers returned from thee who even but now come back again assured of thy fair health recounting it to me this told i joy but then no longer glad i send them back again and straight grow sad mine eye and heart are at a mortal war how to divide the conquest of thy sight mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar my heart mine eye the freedom of that right my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie a closet never pierced with crystal eyes but the defendant doth that plea deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies to side this title is impanelled a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart and by their verdict is determined the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part as thus mine eye's due is thy outward part and my heart's right thy inward love of heart betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took and each doth good turns now unto the other when that mine eye is famished for a look or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother with my love's picture then my eye doth feast and to the painted banquet bids my heart another time mine eye is my heart's guest and in his thoughts of love doth share a part so either by thy picture or my love thy self away art present still with me for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move and i am still with them and they with thee or if they sleep thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight how careful was i when i took my way each trifle under truest bars to thrust that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust but thou to whom my jewels trifles are most worthy comfort now my greatest grief thou best of dearest and mine only care art left the prey of every vulgar thief thee have i not locked up in any chest save where thou art not though i feel thou art within the gentle closure of my breast from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear against that time if ever that time come when i shall see thee frown on my defects when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum called to that audit by advised respects against that time when thou shalt strangely pass and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye when love converted from the thing it was shall reasons find of settled gravity against that time do i ensconce me here within the knowledge of mine own desert and this my hand against my self uprear to guard the lawful reasons on thy part to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws since why to love i can allege no cause how heavy do i journey on the way when what i seek my weary travel's end doth teach that case and that repose to say 'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend' the beast that bears me tired with my woe plods dully on to bear that weight in me as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider loved not speed being made from thee the bloody spur cannot provoke him on that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide which heavily he answers with a groan more sharp to me than spurring to his side for that same groan doth put this in my mind my grief lies onward and my joy behind thus can my love excuse the slow offence of my dull bearer when from thee i speed from where thou art why should i haste me thence till i return of posting is no need o what excuse will my poor beast then find when swift extremity can seem but slow then should i spur though mounted on the wind in winged speed no motion shall i know then can no horse with my desire keep pace therefore desire of perfect'st love being made shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race but love for love thus shall excuse my jade since from thee going he went wilful-slow towards thee i'll run and give him leave to go so am i as the rich whose blessed key can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure the which he will not every hour survey for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare since seldom coming in that long year set like stones of worth they thinly placed are or captain jewels in the carcanet so is the time that keeps you as my chest or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide to make some special instant special-blest by new unfolding his imprisoned pride blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope being had to triumph being lacked to hope what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend describe adonis and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you on helen's cheek all art of beauty set and you in grecian tires are painted new speak of the spring and foison of the year the one doth shadow of your beauty show the other as your bounty doth appear and you in every blessed shape we know in all external grace you have some part but you like none none you for constant heart o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem by that sweet ornament which truth doth give the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour which doth in it live the canker blooms have full as deep a dye as the perfumed tincture of the roses hang on such thorns and play as wantonly when summer's breath their masked buds discloses but for their virtue only is their show they live unwooed and unrespected fade die to themselves sweet roses do not so of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made and so of you beauteous and lovely youth when that shall vade by verse distills your truth not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time when wasteful war shall statues overturn and broils root out the work of masonry nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory 'gainst death and all-oblivious enmity shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom so till the judgment that your self arise you live in this and dwell in lovers' eyes sweet love renew thy force be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite which but to-day by feeding is allayed to-morrow sharpened in his former might so love be thou although to-day thou fill thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness to-morrow see again and do not kill the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore where two contracted new come daily to the banks that when they see return of love more blest may be the view or call it winter which being full of care makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire i have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require nor dare i chide the world-without-end hour whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you nor think the bitterness of absence sour when you have bid your servant once adieu nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be or your affairs suppose but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are how happy you make those so true a fool is love that in your will though you do any thing he thinks no ill that god forbid that made me first your slave i should in thought control your times of pleasure or at your hand th' account of hours to crave being your vassal bound to stay your leisure o let me suffer being at your beck th' imprisoned absence of your liberty and patience tame to sufferance bide each check without accusing you of injury be where you list your charter is so strong that you your self may privilage your time to what you will to you it doth belong your self to pardon of self-doing crime i am to wait though waiting so be hell not blame your pleasure be it ill or well if there be nothing new but that which is hath been before how are our brains beguiled which labouring for invention bear amis the second burthen of a former child o that record could with a backward look even of five hundred courses of the sun show me your image in some antique book since mind at first in character was done that i might see what the old world could say to this composed wonder of your frame whether we are mended or whether better they or whether revolution be the same o sure i am the wits of former days to subjects worse have given admiring praise like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore so do our minutes hasten to their end each changing place with that which goes before in sequent toil all forwards do contend nativity once in the main of light crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight and time that gave doth now his gift confound time doth transfix the flourish set on youth and delves the parallels in beauty's brow feeds on the rarities of nature's truth and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand praising thy worth despite his cruel hand is it thy will thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken while shadows like to thee do mock my sight is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry to find out shames and idle hours in me the scope and tenure of thy jealousy o no thy love though much is not so great it is my love that keeps mine eye awake mine own true love that doth my rest defeat to play the watchman ever for thy sake for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere from me far off with others all too near sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye and all my soul and all my every part and for this sin there is no remedy it is so grounded inward in my heart methinks no face so gracious is as mine no shape so true no truth of such account and for my self mine own worth do define as i all other in all worths surmount but when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity mine own self-love quite contrary i read self so self-loving were iniquity 'tis thee my self that for my self i praise painting my age with beauty of thy days against my love shall be as i am now with time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn hath travelled on to age's steepy night and all those beauties whereof now he's king are vanishing or vanished out of sight stealing away the treasure of his spring for such a time do i now fortify against confounding age's cruel knife that he shall never cut from memory my sweet love's beauty though my lover's life his beauty shall in these black lines be seen and they shall live and he in them still green when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced the rich-proud cost of outworn buried age when sometime lofty towers i see down-rased and brass eternal slave to mortal rage when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore and the firm soil win of the watery main increasing store with loss and loss with store when i have seen such interchange of state or state it self confounded to decay ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have that which it fears to lose since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea but sad mortality o'ersways their power how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea whose action is no stronger than a flower o how shall summer's honey breath hold out against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days when rocks impregnable are not so stout nor gates of steel so strong but time decays o fearful meditation where alack shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back or who his spoil of beauty can forbid o none unless this miracle have might that in black ink my love may still shine bright tired with all these for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy nothing trimmed in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and gilded honour shamefully misplaced and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right perfection wrongfully disgraced and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue-tied by authority and folly doctor-like controlling skill and simple truth miscalled simplicity and captive good attending captain ill tired with all these from these would i be gone save that to die i leave my love alone ah wherefore with infection should he live and with his presence grace impiety that sin by him advantage should achieve and lace it self with his society why should false painting imitate his cheek and steal dead seeming of his living hue why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow since his rose is true why should he live now nature bankrupt is beggared of blood to blush through lively veins for she hath no exchequer now but his and proud of many lives upon his gains o him she stores to show what wealth she had in days long since before these last so bad thus is his cheek the map of days outworn when beauty lived and died as flowers do now before these bastard signs of fair were born or durst inhabit on a living brow before the golden tresses of the dead the right of sepulchres were shorn away to live a second life on second head ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay in him those holy antique hours are seen without all ornament it self and true making no summer of another's green robbing no old to dress his beauty new and him as for a map doth nature store to show false art what beauty was of yore those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due uttering bare truth even so as foes commend thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned but those same tongues that give thee so thine own in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown they look into the beauty of thy mind and that in guess they measure by thy deeds then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds but why thy odour matcheth not thy show the soil is this that thou dost common grow that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect for slander's mark was ever yet the fair the ornament of beauty is suspect a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air so thou be good slander doth but approve thy worth the greater being wooed of time for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love and thou present'st a pure unstained prime thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not assailed or victor being charged yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise to tie up envy evermore enlarged if some suspect of ill masked not thy show then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell nay if you read this line remember not the hand that writ it for i love you so that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot if thinking on me then should make you woe o if i say you look upon this verse when i perhaps compounded am with clay do not so much as my poor name rehearse but let your love even with my life decay lest the wise world should look into your moan and mock you with me after i am gone o lest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in me that you should love after my death dear love forget me quite for you in me can nothing worthy prove unless you would devise some virtuous lie to do more for me than mine own desert and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart o lest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue my name be buried where my body is and live no more to shame nor me nor you for i am shamed by that which i bring forth and so should you to love things nothing worth that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves or none or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang in me thou seest the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west which by and by black night doth take away death's second self that seals up all in rest in me thou seest the glowing of such fire that on the ashes of his youth doth lie as the death-bed whereon it must expire consumed with that which it was nourished by this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong to love that well which thou must leave ere long but be contented when that fell arrest without all bail shall carry me away my life hath in this line some interest which for memorial still with thee shall stay when thou reviewest this thou dost review the very part was consecrate to thee the earth can have but earth which is his due my spirit is thine the better part of me so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life the prey of worms my body being dead the coward conquest of a wretch's knife too base of thee to be remembered the worth of that is that which it contains and that is this and this with thee remains so are you to my thoughts as food to life or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground and for the peace of you i hold such strife as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found now proud as an enjoyer and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure now counting best to be with you alone then bettered that the world may see my pleasure sometime all full with feasting on your sight and by and by clean starved for a look possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had or must from you be took thus do i pine and surfeit day by day or gluttoning on all or all away why is my verse so barren of new pride so far from variation or quick change why with the time do i not glance aside to new-found methods and to compounds strange why write i still all one ever the same and keep invention in a noted weed that every word doth almost tell my name showing their birth and where they did proceed o know sweet love i always write of you and you and love are still my argument so all my best is dressing old words new spending again what is already spent for as the sun is daily new and old so is my love still telling what is told thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear thy dial how thy precious minutes waste these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear and of this book this learning mayst thou taste the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know time's thievish progress to eternity look what thy memory cannot contain commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find those children nursed delivered from thy brain to take a new acquaintance of thy mind these offices so oft as thou wilt look shall profit thee and much enrich thy book so oft have i invoked thee for my muse and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly have added feathers to the learned's wing and given grace a double majesty yet be most proud of that which i compile whose influence is thine and born of thee in others' works thou dost but mend the style and arts with thy sweet graces graced be but thou art all my art and dost advance as high as learning my rude ignorance whilst i alone did call upon thy aid my verse alone had all thy gentle grace but now my gracious numbers are decayed and my sick muse doth give an other place i grant sweet love thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of and pays it thee again he lends thee virtue and he stole that word from thy behaviour beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek he can afford no praise to thee but what in thee doth live then thank him not for that which he doth say since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay o how i faint when i of you do write knowing a better spirit doth use your name and in the praise thereof spends all his might to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame but since your worth wide as the ocean is the humble as the proudest sail doth bear my saucy bark inferior far to his on your broad main doth wilfully appear your shallowest help will hold me up afloat whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride or being wrecked i am a worthless boat he of tall building and of goodly pride then if he thrive and i be cast away the worst was this my love was my decay or i shall live your epitaph to make or you survive when i in earth am rotten from hence your memory death cannot take although in me each part will be forgotten your name from hence immortal life shall have though i once gone to all the world must die the earth can yield me but a common grave when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie your monument shall be my gentle verse which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read and tongues to be your being shall rehearse when all the breathers of this world are dead you still shall live such virtue hath my pen where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men i grant thou wert not married to my muse and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject blessing every book thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue finding thy worth a limit past my praise and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days and do so love yet when they have devised what strained touches rhetoric can lend thou truly fair wert truly sympathized in true plain words by thy true-telling friend and their gross painting might be better used where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused i never saw that you did painting need and therefore to your fair no painting set i found or thought i found you did exceed that barren tender of a poet's debt and therefore have i slept in your report that you your self being extant well might show how far a modern quill doth come too short speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow this silence for my sin you did impute which shall be most my glory being dumb for i impair not beauty being mute when others would give life and bring a tomb there lives more life in one of your fair eyes than both your poets can in praise devise who is it that says most which can say more than this rich praise that you alone are you in whose confine immured is the store which should example where your equal grew lean penury within that pen doth dwell that to his subject lends not some small glory but he that writes of you if he can tell that you are you so dignifies his story let him but copy what in you is writ not making worse what nature made so clear and such a counterpart shall fame his wit making his style admired every where you to your beauteous blessings add a curse being fond on praise which makes your praises worse my tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still while comments of your praise richly compiled reserve their character with golden quill and precious phrase by all the muses filed i think good thoughts whilst other write good words and like unlettered clerk still cry amen to every hymn that able spirit affords in polished form of well refined pen hearing you praised i say 'tis so 'tis true and to the most of praise add something more but that is in my thought whose love to you though words come hindmost holds his rank before then others for the breath of words respect me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect was it the proud full sail of his great verse bound for the prize of all too precious you that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse making their tomb the womb wherein they grew was it his spirit by spirits taught to write above a mortal pitch that struck me dead no neither he nor his compeers by night giving him aid my verse astonished he nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence as victors of my silence cannot boast i was not sick of any fear from thence but when your countenance filled up his line then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine farewell thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou know'st thy estimate the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing my bonds in thee are all determinate for how do i hold thee but by thy granting and for that riches where is my deserving the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting and so my patent back again is swerving thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking so thy great gift upon misprision growing comes home again on better judgement making thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter in sleep a king but waking no such matter when thou shalt be disposed to set me light and place my merit in the eye of scorn upon thy side against my self i'll fight and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn with mine own weakness being best acquainted upon thy part i can set down a story of faults concealed wherein i am attainted that thou in losing me shalt win much glory and i by this will be a gainer too for bending all my loving thoughts on thee the injuries that to my self i do doing thee vantage double-vantage me such is my love to thee i so belong that for thy right my self will bear all wrong say that thou didst forsake me for some fault and i will comment upon that offence speak of my lameness and i straight will halt against thy reasons making no defence thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill to set a form upon desired change as i'll my self disgrace knowing thy will i will acquaintance strangle and look strange be absent from thy walks and in my tongue thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell lest i too much profane should do it wronk and haply of our old acquaintance tell for thee against my self i'll vow debate for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate then hate me when thou wilt if ever now now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow and do not drop in for an after-loss ah do not when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow come in the rearward of a conquered woe give not a windy night a rainy morrow to linger out a purposed overthrow if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last when other petty griefs have done their spite but in the onset come so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortune's might and other strains of woe which now seem woe compared with loss of thee will not seem so some glory in their birth some in their skill some in their wealth some in their body's force some in their garments though new-fangled ill some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure wherein it finds a joy above the rest but these particulars are not my measure all these i better in one general best thy love is better than high birth to me richer than wealth prouder than garments' costs of more delight than hawks and horses be and having thee of all men's pride i boast wretched in this alone that thou mayst take all this away and me most wretchcd make but do thy worst to steal thy self away for term of life thou art assured mine and life no longer than thy love will stay for it depends upon that love of thine then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs when in the least of them my life hath end i see a better state to me belongs than that which on thy humour doth depend thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind since that my life on thy revolt doth lie o what a happy title do i find happy to have thy love happy to die but what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot thou mayst be false and yet i know it not so shall i live supposing thou art true like a deceived husband so love's face may still seem love to me though altered new thy looks with me thy heart in other place for there can live no hatred in thine eye therefore in that i cannot know thy change in many's looks the false heart's history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show they that have power to hurt and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stone unmoved cold and to temptation slow they rightly do inherit heaven's graces and husband nature's riches from expense tibey are the lords and owners of their faces others but stewards of their excellence the summer's flower is to the summer sweet though to it self it only live and die but if that flower with base infection meet the basest weed outbraves his dignity for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which like a canker in the fragrant rose doth spot the beauty of thy budding name o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose that tongue that tells the story of thy days making lascivious comments on thy sport cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise naming thy name blesses an ill report o what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee where beauty's veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see take heed dear heart of this large privilege the hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge some say thy fault is youth some wantonness some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport both grace and faults are loved of more and less thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteemed so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated and for true things deemed how many lambs might the stern wolf betray if like a lamb he could his looks translate how many gazers mightst thou lead away if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report how like a winter hath my absence been from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year what freezings have i felt what dark days seen what old december's bareness everywhere and yet this time removed was summer's time the teeming autumn big with rich increase bearing the wanton burden of the prime like widowed wombs after their lords' decease yet this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans and unfathered fruit for summer and his pleasures wait on thee and thou away the very birds are mute or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near from you have i been absent in the spring when proud-pied april dressed in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in every thing that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any summer's story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew nor did i wonder at the lily's white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet but figures of delight drawn after you you pattern of all those yet seemed it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play the forward violet thus did i chide sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells if not from my love's breath the purple pride which on thy soft check for complexion dwells in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed the lily i condemned for thy hand and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair the roses fearfully on thorns did stand one blushing shame another white despair a third nor red nor white had stol'n of both and to his robbery had annexed thy breath but for his theft in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death more flowers i noted yet i none could see but sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long to speak of that which gives thee all thy might spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song darkening thy power to lend base subjects light return forgetful muse and straight redeem in gentle numbers time so idly spent sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument rise resty muse my love's sweet face survey if time have any wrinkle graven there if any be a satire to decay and make time's spoils despised everywhere give my love fame faster than time wastes life so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife o truant muse what shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed both truth and beauty on my love depends so dost thou too and therein dignified make answer muse wilt thou not haply say 'truth needs no colour with his colour fixed beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay but best is best if never intermixed' because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb excuse not silence so for't lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be praised of ages yet to be then do thy office muse i teach thee how to make him seem long hence as he shows now my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming i love not less though less the show appear that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming the owner's tongue doth publish every where our love was new and then but in the spring when i was wont to greet it with my lays as philomel in summer's front doth sing and stops her pipe in growth of riper days not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night but that wild music burthens every bough and sweets grown common lose their dear delight therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue because i would not dull you with my song alack what poverty my muse brings forth that having such a scope to show her pride the argument all bare is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside o blame me not if i no more can write look in your glass and there appears a face that over-goes my blunt invention quite dulling my lines and doing me disgrace were it not sinful then striving to mend to mar the subject that before was well for to no other pass my verses tend than of your graces and your gifts to tell and more much more than in my verse can sit your own glass shows you when you look in it to me fair friend you never can be old for as you were when first your eye i eyed such seems your beauty still three winters cold have from the forests shook three summers' pride three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned in process of the seasons have i seen three april perfumes in three hot junes burned since first i saw you fresh which yet are green ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand steal from his figure and no pace perceived so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand hath motion and mine eye may be deceived for fear of which hear this thou age unbred ere you were born was beauty's summer dead let not my love be called idolatry nor my beloved as an idol show since all alike my songs and praises be to one of one still such and ever so kind is my love to-day to-morrow kind still constant in a wondrous excellence therefore my verse to constancy confined one thing expressing leaves out difference fair kind and true is all my argument fair kind and true varying to other words and in this change is my invention spent three themes in one which wondrous scope affords fair kind and true have often lived alone which three till now never kept seat in one when in the chronicle of wasted time i see descriptions of the fairest wights and beauty making beautiful old rhyme in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow i see their antique pen would have expressed even such a beauty as you master now so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time all you prefiguring and for they looked but with divining eyes they had not skill enough your worth to sing for we which now behold these present days have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come can yet the lease of my true love control supposed as forfeit to a confined doom the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured and the sad augurs mock their own presage incertainties now crown themselves assured and peace proclaims olives of endless age now with the drops of this most balmy time my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes since spite of him i'll live in this poor rhyme while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes and thou in this shalt find thy monument when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent what's in the brain that ink may character which hath not figured to thee my true spirit what's new to speak what now to register that may express my love or thy dear merit nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine i must each day say o'er the very same counting no old thing old thou mine i thine even as when first i hallowed thy fair name so that eternal love in love's fresh case weighs not the dust and injury of age nor gives to necessary wrinkles place but makes antiquity for aye his page finding the first conceit of love there bred where time and outward form would show it dead o never say that i was false of heart though absence seemed my flame to qualify as easy might i from my self depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie that is my home of love if i have ranged like him that travels i return again just to the time not with the time exchanged so that my self bring water for my stain never believe though in my nature reigned all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood that it could so preposterously be stained to leave for nothing all thy sum of good for nothing this wide universe i call save thou my rose in it thou art my all alas 'tis true i have gone here and there and made my self a motley to the view gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear made old offences of affections new most true it is that i have looked on truth askance and strangely but by all above these blenches gave my heart another youth and worse essays proved thee my best of love now all is done have what shall have no end mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof to try an older friend a god in love to whom i am confined then give me welcome next my heaven the best even to thy pure and most most loving breast o for my sake do you with fortune chide the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds that did not better for my life provide than public means which public manners breeds thence comes it that my name receives a brand and almost thence my nature is subdued to what it works in like the dyer's hand pity me then and wish i were renewed whilst like a willing patient i will drink potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection no bitterness that i will bitter think nor double penance to correct correction pity me then dear friend and i assure ye even that your pity is enough to cure me your love and pity doth th' impression fill which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow for what care i who calls me well or ill so you o'er-green my bad my good allow you are my all the world and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong in so profound abysm i throw all care of others' voices that my adder's sense to critic and to flatterer stopped are mark how with my neglect i do dispense you are so strongly in my purpose bred that all the world besides methinks are dead since i left you mine eye is in my mind and that which governs me to go about doth part his function and is partly blind seems seeing but effectually is out for it no form delivers to the heart of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch of his quick objects hath the mind no part nor his own vision holds what it doth catch for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature the mountain or the sea the day or night the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature incapable of more replete with you my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue or whether doth my mind being crowned with you drink up the monarch's plague this flattery or whether shall i say mine eye saith true and that your love taught it this alchemy to make of monsters and things indigest such cherubins as your sweet self resemble creating every bad a perfect best as fast as objects to his beams assemble o 'tis the first 'tis flattery in my seeing and my great mind most kingly drinks it up mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing and to his palate doth prepare the cup if it be poisoned 'tis the lesser sin that mine eye loves it and doth first begin those lines that i before have writ do lie even those that said i could not love you dearer yet then my judgment knew no reason why my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer but reckoning time whose millioned accidents creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things alas why fearing of time's tyranny might i not then say 'now i love you best' when i was certain o'er incertainty crowning the present doubting of the rest love is a babe then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove o no it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wand'ring bark whose worth's unknown although his height be taken love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom if this be error and upon me proved i never writ nor no man ever loved accuse me thus that i have scanted all wherein i should your great deserts repay forgot upon your dearest love to call whereto all bonds do tie me day by day that i have frequent been with unknown minds and given to time your own dear-purchased right that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight book both my wilfulness and errors down and on just proof surmise accumulate bring me within the level of your frown but shoot not at me in your wakened hate since my appeal says i did strive to prove the constancy and virtue of your love like as to make our appetite more keen with eager compounds we our palate urge as to prevent our maladies unseen we sicken to shun sickness when we purge even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness to be diseased ere that there was true needing thus policy in love t' anticipate the ills that were not grew to faults assured and brought to medicine a healthful state which rank of goodness would by ill be cured but thence i learn and find the lesson true drugs poison him that so feil sick of you what potions have i drunk of siren tears distilled from limbecks foul as hell within applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears still losing when i saw my self to win what wretched errors hath my heart committed whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted in the distraction of this madding fever o benefit of ill now i find true that better is by evil still made better and ruined love when it is built anew grows fairer than at first more strong far greater so i return rebuked to my content and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent that you were once unkind befriends me now and for that sorrow which i then did feel needs must i under my transgression bow unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel for if you were by my unkindness shaken as i by yours y'have passed a hell of time and i a tyrant have no leisure taken to weigh how once i suffered in your crime o that our night of woe might have remembered my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits and soon to you as you to me then tendered the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits but that your trespass now becomes a fee mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me 'tis better to be vile than vile esteemed when not to be receives reproach of being and the just pleasure lost which is so deemed not by our feeling but by others' seeing for why should others' false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood or on my frailties why are frailer spies which in their wills count bad what i think good no i am that i am and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own i may be straight though they themselves be bevel by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown unless this general evil they maintain all men are bad and in their badness reign thy gift thy tables are within my brain full charactered with lasting memory which shall above that idle rank remain beyond all date even to eternity or at the least so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist till each to razed oblivion yield his part of thee thy record never can be missed that poor retention could not so much hold nor need i tallies thy dear love to score therefore to give them from me was i bold to trust those tables that receive thee more to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me no time thou shalt not boast that i do change thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel nothing strange they are but dressings of a former sight our dates are brief and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told thy registers and thee i both defy not wond'ring at the present nor the past for thy records and what we see doth lie made more or less by thy continual haste this i do vow and this shall ever be i will be true despite thy scythe and thee if my dear love were but the child of state it might for fortune's bastard be unfathered as subject to time's love or to time's hate weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered no it was builded far from accident it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls it fears not policy that heretic which works on leases of short-numbered hours but all alone stands hugely politic that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers to this i witness call the fools of time which die for goodness who have lived for crime were't aught to me i bore the canopy with my extern the outward honouring or laid great bases for eternity which proves more short than waste or ruining have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet forgoing simple savour pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent no let me be obsequious in thy heart and take thou my oblation poor but free which is not mixed with seconds knows no art but mutual render only me for thee hence thou suborned informer a true soul when most impeached stands least in thy control o thou my lovely boy who in thy power dost hold time's fickle glass his fickle hour who hast by waning grown and therein show'st thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st if nature sovereign mistress over wrack as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure she may detain but not still keep her treasure her audit though delayed answered must be and her quietus is to render thee in the old age black was not counted fair or if it were it bore not beauty's name but now is black beauty's successive heir and beauty slandered with a bastard shame for since each hand hath put on nature's power fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower but is profaned if not lives in disgrace therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black her eyes so suited and they mourners seem at such who not born fair no beauty lack slandering creation with a false esteem yet so they mourn becoming of their woe that every tongue says beauty should look so how oft when thou my music music play'st upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st the wiry concord that mine ear confounds do i envy those jacks that nimble leap to kiss the tender inward of thy hand whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand to be so tickled they would change their state and situation with those dancing chips o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait making dead wood more blest than living lips since saucy jacks so happy are in this give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action and till action lust is perjured murd'rous bloody full of blame savage extreme rude cruel not to trust enjoyed no sooner but despised straight past reason hunted and no sooner had past reason hated as a swallowed bait on purpose laid to make the taker mad mad in pursuit and in possession so had having and in quest to have extreme a bliss in proof and proved a very woe before a joy proposed behind a dream all this the world well knows yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun coral is far more red than her lips red if snow be white why then her breasts are dun if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head i have seen roses damasked red and white but no such roses see i in her cheeks and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks i love to hear her speak yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound i grant i never saw a goddess go my mistress when she walks treads on the ground and yet by heaven i think my love as rare as any she belied with false compare thou art as tyrannous so as thou art as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel yet in good faith some say that thee behold thy face hath not the power to make love groan to say they err i dare not be so bold although i swear it to my self alone and to be sure that is not false i swear a thousand groans but thinking on thy face one on another's neck do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgment's place in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds and thence this slander as i think proceeds thine eyes i love and they as pitying me knowing thy heart torment me with disdain have put on black and loving mourners be looking with pretty ruth upon my pain and truly not the morning sun of heaven better becomes the grey cheeks of the east nor that full star that ushers in the even doth half that glory to the sober west as those two mourning eyes become thy face o let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace and suit thy pity like in every part then will i swear beauty herself is black and all they foul that thy complexion lack beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me is't not enough to torture me alone but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken and my next self thou harder hast engrossed of him my self and thee i am forsaken a torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee perforce am thine and all that is in me so now i have confessed that he is thine and i my self am mortgaged to thy will my self i'll forfeit so that other mine thou wilt restore to be my comfort still but thou wilt not nor he will not be free for thou art covetous and he is kind he learned but surety-like to write for me under that bond that him as fist doth bind the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take thou usurer that put'st forth all to use and sue a friend came debtor for my sake so him i lose through my unkind abuse him have i lost thou hast both him and me he pays the whole and yet am i not free whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will and 'will' to boot and 'will' in over-plus more than enough am i that vex thee still to thy sweet will making addition thus wilt thou whose will is large and spacious not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine shall will in others seem right gracious and in my will no fair acceptance shine the sea all water yet receives rain still and in abundance addeth to his store so thou being rich in will add to thy will one will of mine to make thy large will more let no unkind no fair beseechers kill think all but one and me in that one 'will' if thy soul check thee that i come so near swear to thy blind soul that i was thy 'will' and will thy soul knows is admitted there thus far for love my love-suit sweet fulfil 'will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love ay fill it full with wills and my will one in things of great receipt with case we prove among a number one is reckoned none then in the number let me pass untold though in thy store's account i one must be for nothing hold me so it please thee hold that nothing me a something sweet to thee make but my name thy love and love that still and then thou lov'st me for my name is will thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes that they behold and see not what they see they know what beauty is see where it lies yet what the best is take the worst to be if eyes corrupt by over-partial looks be anchored in the bay where all men ride why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks whereto the judgment of my heart is tied why should my heart think that a several plot which my heart knows the wide world's common place or mine eyes seeing this say this is not to put fair truth upon so foul a face in things right true my heart and eyes have erred and to this false plague are they now transferred when my love swears that she is made of truth i do believe her though i know she lies that she might think me some untutored youth unlearned in the world's false subtleties thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young although she knows my days are past the best simply i credit her false-speaking tongue on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed but wherefore says she not she is unjust and wherefore say not i that i am old o love's best habit is in seeming trust and age in love loves not to have years told therefore i lie with her and she with me and in our faults by lies we flattered be o call not me to justify the wrong that thy unkindness lays upon my heart wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue use power with power and slay me not by art tell me thou lov'st elsewhere but in my sight dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide let me excuse thee ah my love well knows her pretty looks have been mine enemies and therefore from my face she turns my foes that they elsewhere might dart their injuries yet do not so but since i am near slain kill me outright with looks and rid my pain be wise as thou art cruel do not press my tongue-tied patience with too much disdain lest sorrow lend me words and words express the manner of my pity-wanting pain if i might teach thee wit better it were though not to love yet love to tell me so as testy sick men when their deaths be near no news but health from their physicians know for if i should despair i should grow mad and in my madness might speak ill of thee now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad mad slanderers by mad ears believed be that i may not be so nor thou belied bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes for they in thee a thousand errors note but 'tis my heart that loves what they despise who in despite of view is pleased to dote nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted nor tender feeling to base touches prone nor taste nor smell desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be only my plague thus far i count my gain that she that makes me sin awards me pain love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving o but with mine compare thou thine own state and thou shalt find it merits not reproving or if it do not from those lips of thine that have profaned their scarlet ornaments and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents be it lawful i love thee as thou lov'st those whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee root pity in thy heart that when it grows thy pity may deserve to pitied be if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide by self-example mayst thou be denied lo as a careful huswife runs to catch one of her feathered creatures broke away sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch in pursuit of the thing she would have stay whilst her neglected child holds her in chase cries to catch her whose busy care is bent to follow that which flies before her face not prizing her poor infant's discontent so run'st thou after that which flies from thee whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me and play the mother's part kiss me be kind so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will if thou turn back and my loud crying still two loves i have of comfort and despair which like two spirits do suggest me still the better angel is a man right fair the worser spirit a woman coloured ill to win me soon to hell my female evil tempteth my better angel from my side and would corrupt my saint to be a devil wooing his purity with her foul pride and whether that my angel be turned fiend suspect i may yet not directly tell but being both from me both to each friend i guess one angel in another's hell yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt till my bad angel fire my good one out those lips that love's own hand did make breathed forth the sound that said 'i hate' to me that languished for her sake but when she saw my woeful state straight in her heart did mercy come chiding that tongue that ever sweet was used in giving gentle doom and taught it thus anew to greet 'i hate' she altered with an end that followed it as gentle day doth follow night who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away 'i hate' from hate away she threw and saved my life saying 'not you' poor soul the centre of my sinful earth my sinful earth these rebel powers array why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay why so large cost having so short a lease dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge is this thy body's end then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss and let that pine to aggravate thy store buy terms divine in selling hours of dross within be fed without be rich no more so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men and death once dead there's no more dying then my love is as a fever longing still for that which longer nurseth the disease feeding on that which doth preserve the ill th' uncertain sickly appetite to please my reason the physician to my love angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me and i desperate now approve desire is death which physic did except past cure i am now reason is past care and frantic-mad with evermore unrest my thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are at random from the truth vainly expressed for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright who art as black as hell as dark as night o me what eyes hath love put in my head which have no correspondence with true sight or if they have where is my judgment fled that censures falsely what they see aright if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote what means the world to say it is not so if it be not then love doth well denote love's eye is not so true as all men's no how can it o how can love's eye be true that is so vexed with watching and with tears no marvel then though i mistake my view the sun it self sees not till heaven clears o cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find canst thou o cruel say i love thee not when i against my self with thee partake do i not think on thee when i forgot am of my self all-tyrant for thy sake who hateth thee that i do call my friend on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend revenge upon my self with present moan what merit do i in my self respect that is so proud thy service to despise when all my best doth worship thy defect commanded by the motion of thine eyes but love hate on for now i know thy mind those that can see thou lov'st and i am blind o from what power hast thou this powerful might with insufficiency my heart to sway to make me give the lie to my true sight and swear that brightness doth not grace the day whence hast thou this becoming of things ill that in the very refuse of thy deeds there is such strength and warrantise of skill that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds who taught thee how to make me love thee more the more i hear and see just cause of hate o though i love what others do abhor with others thou shouldst not abhor my state if thy unworthiness raised love in me more worthy i to be beloved of thee love is too young to know what conscience is yet who knows not conscience is born of love then gentle cheater urge not my amiss lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove for thou betraying me i do betray my nobler part to my gross body's treason my soul doth tell my body that he may triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason but rising at thy name doth point out thee as his triumphant prize proud of this pride he is contented thy poor drudge to be to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side no want of conscience hold it that i call her love for whose dear love i rise and fall in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing in act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn in vowing new hate after new love bearing but why of two oaths' breach do i accuse thee when i break twenty i am perjured most for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee and all my honest faith in thee is lost for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness or made them swear against the thing they see for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i to swear against the truth so foul a be cupid laid by

of bad news infects the teller antony when it concerns the fool or coward on things that are past are done with me 'tis thus who tells me true though in his tale lie death i hear him as he flatter'd messenger labienus- this is stiff news- hath with his parthian force extended asia from euphrates his conquering banner shook from syria to lydia and to ionia whilst- antony antony thou wouldst say messenger o my lord antony speak to me home mince not the general tongue name cleopatra as she is call'd in rome rail thou in fulvia's phrase and taunt my faults with such full licence as both truth and malice have power to utter o then we bring forth weeds when our quick minds lie still and our ills told us is as our earing fare thee well awhile messenger at your noble pleasure exit antony from

more serious importeth thee to know this bears gives the letter antony forbear me exit messenger there's a great spirit gone thus did i desire it what our contempts doth often hurl from us we wish it ours again the present pleasure by revolution low'ring does become the opposite of itself she's good being gone the hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on i must from this enchanting queen break off ten thousand harms more than the ills i know my idleness doth hatch how now enobarbus re-enter enobarbus enobarbus what's your pleasure sir antony i must with haste from hence enobarbus why then we kill all our women we see how mortal an unkindness is to them if they suffer our departure death's the word antony i must be gone enobarbus under a compelling occasion let women die it were pity to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing cleopatra catching but the least noise of this dies instantly i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment i do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a celerity in dying antony she is cunning past man's thought enobarbus alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report this cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a show'r of rain as well as jove antony would i had never seen her enobarbus o sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel antony fulvia is dead enobarbus sir antony fulvia is dead enobarbus fulvia antony dead enobarbus why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice when it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new if there were no more women but fulvia then had you indeed a cut and the case to be lamented this grief is crown'd with consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow antony the business she hath broached in the state cannot endure my absence enobarbus and the business you have broach'd here cannot be without you especially that of cleopatra's which wholly depends on your abode antony no more light answers let our officers have notice what we purpose i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part for not alone the death of fulvia with more urgent touches do strongly speak to us but the letters to of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar and commands the empire of the sea our slippery people whose love is never link'd to the deserver till his deserts are past begin to throw pompey the great and all his dignities upon his son who high in name and power higher than both in blood and life stands up for the main soldier whose quality going on the sides o' th' world may danger much is breeding which like the courser's hair hath yet but life and not a serpent's poison say our pleasure to such whose place is under us requires our quick remove from hence enobarbus i shall do't exeunt scene iii alexandria cleopatra's palace enter cleopatra charmian iras and alexas cleopatra where is he charmian i did not see him since cleopatra see where he is who's with him what he does i did not send you if you find him sad say i am dancing if in mirth report

fear enter antony but here comes antony cleopatra i am sick and sullen antony i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose- cleopatra help me away dear charmian i shall fall it cannot be thus long the sides of nature will not sustain it antony now my dearest queen- cleopatra pray you stand farther from me antony what's the matter cleopatra i know by that same eye there's some good news what says the married woman you may go would she had never given you leave to come let her not say 'tis i that keep you here- i have no power upon you hers you are antony the gods best know- cleopatra o never was there queen so mightily betray'd yet at the first i saw the treasons planted antony cleopatra- cleopatra why should i think you can be mine and true though you in swearing shake the throned gods who have been false to fulvia riotous madness to be entangled with those mouth-made vows which break themselves in swearing antony most sweet queen- cleopatra nay pray you seek no colour for your going but bid farewell and go when you sued staying then was the time for words no going then eternity was in our lips and eyes bliss in our brows' bent none our parts so poor but was a race of heaven they are so still or thou the greatest soldier of the world art turn'd the greatest liar antony how now lady cleopatra i would i had thy inches thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt antony hear me queen the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile but my full heart remains in use with you our italy shines o'er with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength are newly grown to love the condemn'd pompey rich in his father's honour creeps apace into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state whose numbers threaten and quietness grown sick of rest would purge by any desperate change my more particular and that which most with you should safe my going is fulvia's death cleopatra though age from folly could not give me freedom it does from childishness can fulvia die antony she's dead my queen look here and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awak'd at the last best see when and where she died cleopatra o most false love where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water now i see i see in fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be antony quarrel no more but be prepar'd to know the purposes i bear which are or cease as you shall give th' advice by the fire that quickens nilus' slime i go from hence thy soldier servant making peace or war as thou affects cleopatra cut my lace charmian come but let it be i am quickly ill and well- so antony loves antony my precious queen forbear and give true evidence to his love which stands an honourable trial cleopatra so fulvia told me i prithee turn aside and weep for her then bid adieu to me and say the tears belong to egypt good now play one scene of excellent dissembling and let it look like perfect honour antony you'll heat my blood no more cleopatra you can do better yet but this is meetly antony now by my sword- cleopatra and target still he mends but this is not the best look prithee charmian how this herculean roman does become the carriage of his chafe antony i'll leave you lady cleopatra courteous lord one word sir you and i must part- but that's not it sir you and i have lov'd- but there's not it that you know well something it is i would- o my oblivion is a very antony and i am all forgotten antony but that your royalty holds idleness your subject i should take you for idleness itself cleopatra 'tis sweating labour to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this but sir forgive me since my becomings kill me when they do not eye well to you your honour calls you hence therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly and all the gods go with you upon your sword sit laurel victory and smooth success be strew'd before your feet antony let us go come our separation so abides and flies that thou residing here goes yet with me and i hence fleeting here remain with thee away exeunt scene iv rome caesar's house enter octavius caesar reading a letter lepidus and their train caesar you may see lepidus and henceforth know it is not caesar's natural vice to hate our great competitor from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsaf'd to think he had partners you shall find there a man who is the abstract of all faults that all men follow lepidus i must not think there are evils enow to darken all his goodness his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven more fiery by night's blackness hereditary rather than purchas'd what he cannot change than what he chooses caesar you are too indulgent let's grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes him- as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish- yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness if he fill'd his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for't but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge pawn their experience to their present pleasure and so rebel to judgment enter a messenger lepidus here's more news messenger thy biddings have been done and every hour most noble caesar shalt thou have report how 'tis abroad pompey is strong at sea and it appears he is belov'd of those that only have fear'd caesar to the ports the discontents repair and men's reports give him much wrong'd caesar i should have known no less it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wish'd until he were and the ebb'd man ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love comes dear'd by being lack'd this common body like to a vagabond flag upon the stream goes to and back lackeying the varying tide to rot itself with motion messenger caesar i bring thee word menecrates and menas famous pirates make the sea serve them which they ear and wound with keels of every kind many hot inroads they make in italy the borders maritime lack blood to think on't and flush youth revolt no vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon taken as seen for pompey's name strikes more than could his war resisted caesar antony leave thy lascivious wassails when thou once was beaten from modena where thou slew'st hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel did famine follow whom thou fought'st against though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou brows'd on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this- it wounds thine honour that i speak it now- was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lank'd not lepidus 'tis pity of him caesar let his shames quickly drive him to rome 'tis time we twain did show ourselves i' th' field and to that end assemble we immediate council pompey thrives in our idleness lepidus to-morrow caesar i shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time caesar till which encounter it is my business too

at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concern'd me antony my being in egypt caesar what was't to you caesar no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet if you there did practise on my state your being in egypt might be my question antony how intend you- practis'd caesar you may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war antony you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if you'll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this caesar you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patch'd up your excuses antony not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain on't very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o' th' world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife enobarbus would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women antony so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience- which not wanted shrewdness of policy too- i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say i could not help it caesar i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience antony sir he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i' th' morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have ask'd him pardon let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him caesar you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with lepidus soft caesar antony no lepidus let him speak the honour is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lack'd it but on caesar the article of my oath- caesar to lend me arms and aid when i requir'd them the which you both denied antony neglected rather and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may i'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case lepidus 'tis noble spoken maecenas if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye- to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you lepidus worthily spoken maecenas enobarbus or if you borrow one another's love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of pompey return it again you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do antony thou art a soldier only speak no more enobarbus that truth should be silent i had almost forgot antony you wrong this presence therefore speak no more enobarbus go to then- your considerate stone caesar i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech for't cannot be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so diff'ring in their acts yet if i knew what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge o' th' world i would pursue it agrippa give me leave caesar caesar speak agrippa agrippa thou hast a sister by the mother's side admir'd octavia great mark antony is now a widower caesar say not so agrippa if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deserv'd of rashness antony i am not married caesar let me hear agrippa further speak agrippa to hold you in perpetual amity to make you brothers and to knit your hearts with an unslipping knot take antony octavia to his wife whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men whose virtue and whose general graces speak that which none else can utter by this marriage all little jealousies which now seem great and all great fears which now import their dangers would then be nothing truths would be tales where now half tales be truths her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her pardon what i have spoke for 'tis a studied not a present thought by duty ruminated antony will caesar speak caesar not till he hears how antony is touch'd with what is spoke already antony what power is in agrippa if i would say 'agrippa be it so' to make this good caesar the power of caesar and his power unto octavia antony may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs caesar there is my hand a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again lepidus happily amen antony i did not think to draw my sword 'gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great

heart upon the river of cydnus agrippa there she appear'd indeed or my reporter devis'd well for her enobarbus i will tell you the barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne burn'd on the water the poop was beaten gold purple the sails and so perfumed that the winds were love-sick with them the oars were silver which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made the water which they beat to follow faster as amorous of their strokes for her own person it beggar'd all description she did lie in her pavilion cloth-of-gold of tissue o'erpicturing that venus where we see the fancy out-work nature on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids with divers-colour'd fans whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool and what they undid did agrippa o rare for antony enobarbus her gentlewomen like the nereides so many mermaids tended her i' th' eyes and made their bends adornings at the helm a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands that yarely frame the office from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs the city cast her people out upon her and antony enthron'd i' th' market-place did sit alone whistling to th' air which but for vacancy had gone to gaze on cleopatra too and made a gap in nature agrippa rare egyptian enobarbus upon her landing antony sent to her invited her to supper she replied it should be better he became her guest which she entreated our courteous antony whom ne'er the word of 'no' woman heard speak being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast and for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only agrippa royal wench she made great caesar lay his sword to bed he ploughed her and she cropp'd enobarbus i saw her once hop forty paces through the public street and having lost her breath she spoke and panted that she did make defect perfection and breathless pow'r breathe forth maecenas now antony must leave her utterly enobarbus never he will not age cannot wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety other women cloy the appetites they feed but she makes hungry where most she satisfies for vilest things become themselves in her that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish maecenas if beauty wisdom modesty can settle the heart of antony octavia is a blessed lottery to him agrippa let us go good

stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave celia by our beards if we had them thou art touchstone by my knavery if i had it then i were but if you swear by that that not you are not

old smell le beau you amaze me ladies i would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight of rosalind yet tell us the manner of the wrestling le beau i will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it celia well the beginning that is dead and buried le beau there comes an old man and his three sons- celia i could match this beginning with an old tale le beau three proper young men of excellent growth and presence rosalind with bills on their necks 'be it known unto all men by these presents'- le beau the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the duke's wrestler which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him so he serv'd the second and so the third yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping rosalind alas touchstone but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost le beau why this that i speak of touchstone thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies celia or i i promise thee rosalind but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking shall we see this wrestling

young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years you have seen cruel proof of this man's strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise we pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt rosalind do young sir your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward orlando i beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if i be foil'd there is but one sham'd that was never gracious if kill'd but one dead that is willing to be so i shall do my friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the world no injury for in it i have nothing only in the world i fill up a place which may be better supplied when i have made it empty rosalind the little strength that i have i would it were with you celia and mine to eke out hers rosalind fare you well pray heaven i be deceiv'd in you celia your heart's desires be with you

hadst told me of another father exeunt duke train and le beau celia were i my father coz would i do this orlando i am more proud to be sir rowland's son his youngest son- and would not change that calling to be adopted heir to frederick rosalind my father lov'd sir rowland as his soul and all the world was of my father's mind had i before known this young man his son i should have given him tears unto entreaties ere he should thus have ventur'd celia gentle cousin let us go thank him and encourage him my father's rough and envious disposition sticks me at heart sir you have well deserv'd if you do keep your promises in love but justly as you have exceeded all promise your mistress shall be happy rosalind gentleman giving him a chain from her neck wear this for me one out of suits with fortune that could give more but that her hand lacks means shall we go coz celia ay fare you well fair gentleman orlando can i not say 'i thank you' my better parts are all thrown down and that which here stands up is but a quintain a mere lifeless block rosalind he calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes i'll ask him what he would did you call sir sir you have wrestled well and overthrown more than your enemies celia will you go coz rosalind have with you fare you well exeunt rosalind and celia orlando what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue i cannot speak to her yet she urg'd conference o poor orlando thou art overthrown or charles or something weaker masters thee re-enter le beau le beau good sir i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place albeit you have deserv'd high commendation true applause and love yet such is now the duke's condition that he misconstrues all that you have done the duke is humorous what he is indeed more suits you to conceive than i to speak of orlando i thank you sir and pray you tell me this which of the two was daughter of the duke that here was at the wrestling le beau neither his daughter if we judge by manners but yet indeed the smaller is his daughter the other is daughter to the banish'd duke and here detain'd by her usurping uncle to keep his daughter company whose loves are dearer than the natural bond of sisters but i can tell you that of late this duke hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues and pity her for her good father's sake and on my life his malice 'gainst the lady will suddenly break forth sir fare you well hereafter in a better world than this i shall desire more love and knowledge of you orlando i rest much bounden to you fare you well exit le beau thus must i from the smoke into the smother from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother but heavenly rosalind exit scene iii the duke's palace enter celia and

o they take the part of a better wrestler than myself celia o a good wish upon you you will try in time in despite of a fall but turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowland's youngest son rosalind the duke my father lov'd his father dearly celia doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly by this kind of chase i should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate not orlando rosalind no faith hate him not for my sake celia why should i not doth he not deserve well enter duke frederick with lords rosalind let me love him for that and do you love him because i do look here comes the duke celia with his eyes full of anger frederick mistress dispatch

lords like foresters duke senior now my co-mates and brothers in exile hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court here feel we not the penalty of adam the seasons' difference as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter's wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say 'this is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am' sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything i would not change it amiens happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style duke senior come shall we go and kill us venison and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert

extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears duke senior but what said jaques did he not moralize this spectacle first lord o yes into a thousand similes first for his weeping into the needless stream 'poor deer' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much' then being there alone left and abandoned of his velvet friends ''tis right' quoth he 'thus misery doth part the flux of company' anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him 'ay' quoth jaques 'sweep on you fat and greasy citizens 'tis just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there' thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and what's worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assign'd and native dwelling-place duke senior and did you leave him in this

senior amiens and lords like outlaws duke senior i think he be transform'd into a beast for i can nowhere find him like a man first lord my lord he is but even now gone hence here was he merry hearing of a song duke senior if he compact of jars grow musical we shall have shortly discord in the spheres go seek him tell him i would speak with him enter jaques first lord he saves my labour by his own approach duke senior why how now monsieur what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company what you look merrily jaques a fool a fool i met a fool i' th' forest a motley fool a miserable world as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun and rail'd on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms- and yet a motley fool 'good morrow fool' quoth i 'no sir' quoth he 'call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune' and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lack-lustre eye says very wisely 'it is ten o'clock thus we may see' quoth he 'how the world wags 'tis but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more 'twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale' when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial o noble fool a worthy fool motley's the only wear duke senior what fool is this jaques o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd with observation the which he vents in mangled forms o that i were a fool i am ambitious for a motley coat duke senior thou shalt have one jaques it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have and they that are most galled with my folly they most must laugh and why sir must they so the why is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise man's folly is anatomiz'd even by the squand'ring glances of the fool invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th' infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine duke senior fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do jaques what for a counter would i do but good duke senior most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine as sensual as the brutish sting itself and all th' embossed sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world jaques why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the wearer's very means do ebb what woman in the city do i name when that i say the city-woman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbour or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech there then how then what then let me see wherein my tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies unclaim'd of any man but who comes here enter orlando with his sword drawn orlando forbear and eat no more jaques why i have eat none yet orlando nor shalt not till necessity be serv'd jaques of what kind should this cock come of duke senior art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress or else a rude despiser of good manners that in civility thou seem'st so empty orlando you touch'd my vein at first the thorny point of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show of smooth civility yet arn i inland bred and know some nurture but forbear i say he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered jaques an you will not be answer'd with reason i must die duke senior what would you have your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness orlando i almost die for food and let me have it duke senior sit down and feed and welcome to our table orlando speak you so gently pardon me i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment but whate'er you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have look'd on better days if ever been where bells have knoll'd to church if ever sat at any good man's feast if ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear and know what 'tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush and hide my sword duke senior true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knoll'd to church and sat at good men's feasts and wip'd our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be minist'red orlando then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and give it food there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limp'd in pure love till he be first suffic'd oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit duke senior go find him out and we will nothing waste till you return orlando i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort exit duke senior thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in jaques all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurse's arms then the whining school-boy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress' eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon's mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lin'd with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well sav'd a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing re-enter orlando with adam duke senior welcome set down your venerable burden and let him feed orlando i thank you most for him adam so had you need i scarce can speak to thank you for myself duke

carved upon these trees rosalind i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what i found on a palm-tree i was never so berhym'd since pythagoras' time that i was an irish rat which i can hardly remember celia trow you who hath done this rosalind is it a man celia and a chain that you once wore about his neck change you colour rosalind i prithee who celia o lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes and so encounter rosalind nay but who is it celia is it possible rosalind nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is celia o wonderful wonderful most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all whooping rosalind good my complexion dost thou think though i am caparison'd like a man i have a doublet and hose in my disposition one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace i would thou could'st stammer that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle- either too much at once or none at all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that i may drink thy tidings celia so you may put a man in your belly rosalind is he of god's making what manner of man is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard celia nay he hath but a little beard rosalind why god will send more if the man will be thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin celia it is young orlando that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels and your heart both in an instant rosalind nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and true maid celia i' faith coz 'tis he rosalind orlando celia orlando rosalind alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and hose what did he when thou saw'st him what said he how look'd he wherein went he what makes he here did he ask for me where remains he how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see him again answer me in one word celia you must borrow me gargantua's mouth first 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism rosalind but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man's apparel looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled celia it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance i found him under a tree like a dropp'd acorn rosalind it may well be call'd jove's tree when it drops forth such fruit celia give me audience good madam rosalind proceed celia there lay he stretch'd along like a wounded knight rosalind though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground celia cry 'holla' to thy tongue i prithee it curvets unseasonably he was furnish'd like a hunter rosalind o ominous he comes to kill my heart celia i would sing my song without a burden thou bring'st me out of tune rosalind do you not know i am a woman when i think i must speak sweet say on celia you bring me out soft comes he not here enter orlando and jaques rosalind 'tis he slink by and note him jaques i thank you for your company but good faith i had as lief have been myself alone orlando and so had i but yet for fashion sake i thank you too for your society jaques god buy you let's meet as little as we can orlando i do desire we may be better strangers jaques i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks orlando i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly jaques rosalind is your love's name orlando yes just jaques i do not like her name orlando there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christen'd jaques what stature is she of orlando just as high as my heart jaques you are full of pretty answers have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives and conn'd them out of rings orlando not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions jaques you have a nimble wit i think 'twas made of atalanta's heels will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery orlando i will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom i know most faults jaques the worst fault you have is to be in love orlando 'tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue i am weary of you jaques by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you orlando he is drown'd in the brook look but in and you shall see him jaques there i shall see mine own figure orlando which i take to be either a fool or a cipher jaques i'll tarry no longer with you farewell good signior love orlando i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur melancholy exit jaques rosalind aside to celia i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him- do you hear forester orlando very well what would you rosalind i pray you what is't o'clock orlando you should ask me what time o' day there's no clock in the forest rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper rosalind by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons i'll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal orlando i prithee who doth he trot withal rosalind marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd if the interim be but a se'nnight time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year orlando who ambles time withal rosalind with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal orlando who doth he gallop withal rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there orlando who stays it still withal rosalind with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves orlando where dwell you pretty youth rosalind with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat orlando are you native of this place rosalind as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled orlando your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling rosalind i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal orlando can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women rosalind there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow-fault came to match it orlando i prithee recount some of them rosalind no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving 'rosalind' on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancy-monger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him orlando i am he that is so love-shak'd i pray you tell me your remedy rosalind there is none of my uncle's marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner orlando what were his marks rosalind a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue then your hose should be ungarter'd your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbutton'd your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather point-device in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other orlando fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love rosalind me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired orlando i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he rosalind but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak orlando neither rhyme nor reason can express how much rosalind love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel orlando did you ever cure any so rosalind yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i cur'd him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart that there shall not be one spot of love in 't orlando i would not be cured youth rosalind i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me orlando now by the faith of my love i will tell me where it is rosalind go with me to it and i'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live will you go orlando with all my heart good youth rosalind nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go exeunt scene iii the forest enter touchstone and audrey jaques behind touchstone come apace good audrey i will fetch up your goats audrey and how audrey am i the man yet doth my simple feature content you audrey your features lord warrant us what features touchstone i am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths jaques aside o knowledge ill-inhabited worse than jove in a thatch'd house touchstone when a man's verses cannot be understood nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room truly i would the gods had made thee poetical audrey i do not know what 'poetical' is is it honest in deed and word is it a true thing touchstone no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign audrey do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical touchstone i do truly for thou swear'st to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst feign audrey would you not have me honest touchstone no truly unless thou wert hard-favour'd for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar jaques aside a material fool audrey well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods make me honest touchstone truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish audrey i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul touchstone well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may be i will marry thee and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next village who hath promis'd to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us jaques aside i would fain see this meeting audrey well the gods give us joy touchstone amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but horn-beasts but what though courage as horns are odious they are necessary it is said 'many a man knows no end of his goods' right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them well that is the dowry of his wife 'tis none of his own getting horns even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man therefore blessed no as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is horn more precious than to want here comes sir oliver enter sir oliver martext sir oliver martext you are well met will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel martext is there none here to give the woman touchstone i will not take her on gift of any man martext truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful jaques discovering himself proceed proceed i'll give her touchstone good even good master what-ye-call't how do you sir you are very well met goddild you for your last company i am very glad to see you even a toy in hand here sir nay pray be cover'd jaques will you be married motley touchstone as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling jaques and will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp touchstone aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife jaques go thou with me and let me counsel thee touchstone come sweet audrey we must be married or we must live in bawdry farewell good master oliver not- o sweet oliver o brave oliver leave me not behind thee but- wind away begone i say i will not to wedding with thee exeunt jaques touchstone and audrey martext 'tis no matter ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling exit scene iv the forest enter rosalind and celia rosalind never talk to me i will weep celia do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man rosalind but have i not cause to weep celia as good cause as one would desire therefore weep rosalind his very hair is of the dissembling colour celia something browner than judas's marry his kisses are judas's own children rosalind i' faith his hair is of a good colour celia an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour rosalind and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread celia he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them rosalind but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not celia nay certainly there is no truth in him rosalind do you think so celia yes i think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer but for his verity in love i do think him as concave as covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut rosalind not true in love celia yes when he is in but i think he is not in rosalind you have heard him swear downright he was celia 'was' is not 'is' besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends here in the forest on the duke your father rosalind i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laugh'd and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando celia o that's a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose but all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides who comes here enter corin corin mistress and master you have oft enquired after the shepherd that complain'd of love who you saw sitting by me on the turf praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress celia well and what of him corin if you will see a pageant truly play'd between the pale complexion of true love and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain go hence a little and i shall conduct you if you will mark it rosalind o come let us remove the sight of lovers feedeth those in love bring us to this sight and you shall say i'll prove a busy actor in their play exeunt scene v another part of the forest enter silvius and phebe silvius sweet phebe do not scorn me do not phebe say that you love me not but say not so in bitterness the common executioner whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops enter rosalind celia and corin at a distance phebe i would not be thy executioner i fly thee for i would not injure thee thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye 'tis pretty sure and very probable that eyes that are the frail'st and softest things who shut their coward gates on atomies should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers now i do frown on thee with all my heart and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down or if thou canst not o for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean upon a rush the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes which i have darted at thee hurt thee not nor i am sure there is not force in eyes that can do hurt silvius o dear phebe if ever- as that ever may be near- you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy then shall you know the wounds invisible that love's keen arrows make phebe but till that time come not thou near me and when that time comes afflict me with thy mocks pity me not as till that time i shall not pity thee rosalind advancing and why i pray you who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched what though you have no beauty- as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed- must you be therefore proud and pitiless why what means this why do you look on me i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature's sale-work 'od's my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too no faith proud mistress hope not after it 'tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman 'tis such fools as you that makes the world full of ill-favour'd children 'tis not her glass but you that flatters her and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her but mistress know yourself down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good man's love for i must tell you friendly in your ear sell when you can you are not for all markets cry the man mercy love him take his offer foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer so take her to thee shepherd fare you well phebe sweet youth i pray you chide a year together i had rather hear you chide than this man woo rosalind he's fall'n in love with your foulness and she'll fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks i'll sauce her with bitter words why look you so upon me phebe for no ill will i bear you rosalind i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine besides i like you not if you will know my house 'tis at the tuft of olives here hard by will you go sister shepherd ply her hard come sister shepherdess look on him better and be not proud though all the world could see none could be so abus'd in sight as he come to our flock exeunt rosalind celia and corin phebe dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might 'who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight' silvius sweet phebe phebe ha what say'st thou silvius silvius sweet phebe pity me phebe why i arn sorry for thee gentle silvius silvius wherever sorrow is relief would be if you do sorrow at my grief in love by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermin'd phebe thou hast my love is not that neighbourly silvius i would have you phebe why that were covetousness silvius the time was that i hated thee and yet it is not that i bear thee love but since that thou canst talk of love so well thy company which erst was irksome to me i will endure and i'll employ thee too but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd silvius so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps loose now and then a scatt'red smile and that i'll live upon phebe know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile silvius not very well but i have met him oft and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of phebe think not i love him though i ask for him 'tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well but what care i for words yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear it is a pretty youth- not very pretty but sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him he'll make a proper man the best thing in him is his complexion and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up he is not very tall yet for his years he's tall his leg is but so-so and yet 'tis well there was a pretty redness in his lip a little riper and more lusty red than that mix'd in his cheek 'twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask there be some women silvius had they mark'd him in parcels as i did would have gone near to fall in love with him but for my part i love him not nor hate him not and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and now i am rememb'red scorn'd at me i marvel why i answer'd not again but that's all one omittance is no quittance i'll write to him a very taunting letter and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius silvius phebe with all my heart phebe i'll write it straight the matter's in my head and in my heart i will be bitter with him and passing short go with me silvius

better acquainted with thee rosalind they say you are a melancholy fellow jaques i am so i do love it better than laughing rosalind those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards jaques why 'tis good to be sad and say nothing rosalind why then 'tis good to be a post jaques i have neither the scholar's melancholy which is emulation nor the musician's which is fantastical nor the courtier's which is proud nor the soldier's which is ambitious nor the lawyer's which is politic nor the lady's which is nice nor the lover's which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness rosalind a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands jaques yes i have gain'd my experience enter orlando rosalind and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to travel for it too orlando good day and happiness dear rosalind jaques nay then god buy you an you talk in blank verse rosalind farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola exit

rosalind break an hour's promise in love he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder but i'll warrant him heart-whole orlando pardon me dear rosalind rosalind nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i had as lief be woo'd of a snail orlando of a snail rosalind ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head- a better jointure i think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him orlando what's that rosalind why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife orlando virtue is no horn-maker and my rosalind is virtuous rosalind and i am your rosalind celia it pleases him to call you so but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you rosalind come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind orlando i would kiss before i spoke rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were gravell'd for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking- god warn us- matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss orlando how if the kiss be denied rosalind then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter orlando who could be out being before his beloved mistress rosalind marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit orlando what of my suit rosalind not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit am not i your rosalind orlando i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you orlando then in mine own person i die rosalind no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love-cause troilus had his brains dash'd out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have liv'd many a fair year though hero had turn'd nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drown'd and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was- hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love orlando i would not have my right rosalind of this mind for i protest her frown might kill me rosalind by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more coming-on disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it orlando then love me rosalind rosalind yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all orlando and wilt thou have me

us give me your hand orlando what do you say sister orlando pray thee marry us celia i cannot say the words rosalind you must begin 'will you orlando'- celia go to will you orlando have to wife this rosalind orlando i will rosalind ay but when orlando why now as fast as she can marry us rosalind then you must say 'i take thee rosalind for wife' orlando i take thee rosalind for wife rosalind i might ask you for your commission but- i do take thee orlando for my husband there's a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actions orlando so do all thoughts they are wing'd rosalind now tell me how long you would have her after you have possess'd her orlando for ever and a day rosalind say 'a day' without the 'ever' no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock-pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more new-fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are dispos'd to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when thou are inclin'd to sleep orlando but will my rosalind do so rosalind by my life she will do as i do orlando o but she is wise rosalind or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out at the casement shut that and 'twill out at the key-hole stop that 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney orlando a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say 'wit whither wilt' rosalind nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed orlando and what wit could wit have to excuse that rosalind marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool orlando for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee rosalind alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours orlando i must attend the duke at dinner by two o'clock i will be with thee again rosalind ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me 'tis but one cast away and so come death two o'clock is your hour orlando ay sweet rosalind rosalind by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise orlando with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind so adieu rosalind well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try adieu exit orlando celia you have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate we must

give you this i know not the contents but as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it it bears an angry tenour pardon me i am but as a guiltless messenger rosalind patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer bear this bear all she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix 'od's my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device silvius no i protest i know not the contents phebe did write it rosalind come come you are a fool and turn'd into the extremity of love i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestone-colour'd hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands she has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter i say she never did invent this letter this is a man's invention and his hand silvius sure it is hers rosalind why 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers why she defies me like turk to christian women's gentle brain could not drop forth such giant-rude invention such ethiope words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter silvius so please you for i never heard it yet yet heard too much of phebe's cruelty rosalind she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes reads 'art thou god to shepherd turn'd that a maiden's heart hath burn'd' can a woman rail thus silvius call you this railing rosalind 'why thy godhead laid apart warr'st thou with a woman's heart' did you ever hear such railing 'whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me' meaning me a beast 'if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move he that brings this love to the little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then i'll study how to die' silvius call you this chiding celia alas poor shepherd rosalind do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endur'd well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee tame snake and say this to her- that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company exit silvius enter oliver oliver good morrow fair ones pray you if you know where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees celia west of this place down in the neighbour bottom the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place but at this hour the house doth keep itself there's none within oliver if that an eye may profit by a tongue then should i know you by description- such garments and such years 'the boy is fair of female favour and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother' are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for celia it is no boast being ask'd to say we are oliver orlando doth commend him to you both and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin are you he rosalind i am what must we understand by this oliver some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was stain'd celia i pray you tell it oliver when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself who with her head nimble in threats approach'd the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlink'd itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bush's shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for 'tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother celia o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that liv'd amongst men oliver and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural rosalind but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suck'd and hungry lioness oliver twice did he turn his back and purpos'd so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awak'd celia are you his brother rosalind was't you he rescu'd celia was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him oliver 'twas i but 'tis not i i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am rosalind but for the bloody napkin oliver by and by when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd as how i came into that desert place- in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brother's love who led me instantly unto his cave there stripp'd himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recover'd him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dy'd in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind rosalind swoons celia why how now ganymede sweet ganymede oliver many will swoon when they do look on blood celia there is more in it cousin ganymede oliver look he recovers rosalind i would i were at home celia

yet this my comfort when your words are done my woes end likewise with the evening sun duke well syracusian say in brief the cause why thou departed'st from thy native home and for what cause thou cam'st to ephesus aegeon a heavier task could not have been impos'd than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature not by vile offence i'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave in syracuse was i born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad with her i liv'd in joy our wealth increas'd by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factor's death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be disdnguish'd but by names that very hour and in the self-same inn a mean woman was delivered of such a burden male twins both alike those for their parents were exceeding poor i bought and brought up to attend my sons my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard a league from epidamnum had we sail'd before the always-wind-obeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embrac'd yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear forc'd me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinking-ripe to us my wife more careful for the latter-born had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast such as sea-faring men provide for storms to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus dispos'd my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast and floating straight obedient to the stream was carried towards corinth as we thought at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispers'd those vapours that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas wax'd calm and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us- of corinth that of epidaurus this but ere they came-o let me say no more gather the sequel by that went before duke nay forward old man do not break off so for we may pity though not pardon thee aegeon o had the gods done so i had not now worthily term'd them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encount'red by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seiz'd on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck'd guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolong'd to tell sad stories of my own mishaps duke and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for do me the favour to dilate at full what have befall'n of them and thee till now aegeon my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importun'd me that his attendant-so his case was like reft of his brother but retain'd his name- might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i laboured of a love to see i hazarded the loss of whom i lov'd five summers have i spent in farthest greece roaming clean through the bounds of asia and coasting homeward came to ephesus hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbours men but here must end the story of my life and happy were i in my timely death could all my travels warrant me they live duke hapless aegeon whom the fates have mark'd to bear the extremity of dire mishap now trust me were it not against our laws against my crown my

die than to famish all resolv'd resolv'd first citizen first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people all we know't we know't first citizen let us kill him and we'll have corn at our own price is't a verdict all no more talking on't let it be done away away second citizen one word good citizens first citizen we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularize their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge second citizen would you proceed especially against caius marcius first citizen against him first he's a very dog to the commonalty second citizen consider you what services he has done for his country first citizen very well and could be content to give him good report for't but that he pays himself with being proud second citizen nay but speak not maliciously first citizen i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtue second citizen what he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous first citizen if i must not i need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition shouts within what shouts are these the other side o' th' city is risen why stay we prating here to th' capitol all come come first citizen soft who comes here enter menenius agrippa second citizen worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always lov'd the people first citizen he's one honest enough would all the rest were so menenius what work's my countrymen in hand where go you with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you first citizen our business is not unknown to th' senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now we'll show 'em in deeds they say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms too menenius why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours will you undo yourselves first citizen we cannot sir we are undone already menenius i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you for your wants your suffering in this dearth you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o' th' state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies first citizen care for us true indeed they ne'er car'd for us yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses cramm'd with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and there's all the love they bear us menenius either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accus'd of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale't a little more first citizen well i'll hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but an't please you deliver menenius there was a time when all the body's members rebell'd against the belly thus accus'd it that only like a gulf it did remain i' th' midst o' th' body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labour with the rest where th' other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body the belly answer'd- first citizen well sir what answer made the belly menenius sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus- for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speak- it tauntingly replied to th' discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you first citizen your belly's answer- what the kingly crowned head the vigilant eye the counsellor heart the arm our soldier our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter with other muniments and petty helps is this our fabric if that they- menenius what then fore me this fellow speaks what then what then first citizen should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd who is the sink o' th' body- menenius well what then first citizen the former agents if they did complain what could the belly answer menenius i will tell you if you'll bestow a small- of what you have little- patience awhile you'st hear the belly's answer first citizen y'are long about it menenius note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answered 'true is it my incorporate friends' quoth he 'that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to th' seat o' th' brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once you my good friends'- this says the belly mark me first citizen ay sir well well menenius 'though all at once cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran' what say you to' t first citizen it was an answer how apply you this menenius the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o' th' common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves what do you think you the great toe of this assembly first citizen i the great toe why the great toe menenius for that being one o' th' lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost thou rascal that art worst in blood to run lead'st first to win some vantage but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale enter caius marcius hail noble marcius marcius thanks what's the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs first citizen we have ever your good word marcius he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick man's appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland what's the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another what's their seeking menenius for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stor'd marcius hang 'em they say they'll sit by th' fire and presume to know what's done i' th' capitol who's like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say there's grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword i'd make a quarry with thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high as i could pick my lance menenius nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop marcius they are dissolv'd hang 'em they said they were an-hungry sigh'd forth proverbs- that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answer'd and a petition granted them- a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look pale- they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon shouting their emulation menenius what is granted them marcius five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice one's junius brutus- sicinius velutus and i know not 'sdeath the rabble should have first unroof'd the city ere so prevail'd with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection's arguing menenius this is strange marcius go get you home you fragments enter a messenger hastily messenger where's caius marcius marcius here what's the matter messenger the news is sir the volsces are in arms marcius i am glad on't then we shall ha' means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders enter cominius titus lartius with other senators junius brutus and sicinius velutus first senator marcius 'tis true that you have lately told us the volsces are in arms marcius they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to't i sin in envying his nobility and were i anything but what i am i would wish me only he cominius you have fought together marcius were half to half the world by th' ears and he upon my party i'd revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt first senator then worthy marcius attend upon cominius to these wars cominius it is your former promise marcius sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus' face what art thou stiff stand'st out lartius no caius marcius i'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other ere stay behind this business menenius o true bred first senator your company to th' capitol where i know our greatest friends attend us lartius to cominius lead you on to marcius follow cominius we must follow you right worthy you priority cominius noble marcius first senator to the citizens hence to your homes be gone marcius nay let them follow the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners worshipful mutineers your valour puts well forth pray follow ciitzens steal away exeunt all but sicinius and brutus sicinius was ever man so proud as is this marcius brutus he has no equal sicinius when we were chosen tribunes for the people- brutus mark'd you his lip and eyes sicinius nay but his taunts brutus being mov'd he will not spare to gird the gods sicinius bemock the modest moon brutus the present wars devour him he is grown too proud to be so valiant sicinius such a nature tickled with good success disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius brutus fame at the which he aims- in whom already he is well grac'd- cannot better be held nor more attain'd than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the general's fault though he perform to th' utmost of a man and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius 'o if he had borne the business' sicinius besides if things go well opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius brutus come half all cominius' honours are to marcius though marcius earn'd them not and all his faults to marcius shall be honours though indeed in aught he merit not sicinius let's hence and hear how the dispatch is made and in what fashion more than his singularity he goes upon this present action brutus let's along exeunt scene ii corioli the senate house enter tullus aufidius with senators of corioli first senator so your opinion is aufidius that they of rome are ent'red in our counsels and know how we proceed aufidius is it not yours what ever have been thought on in this state that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention 'tis not four days gone since i heard thence these are the words- i think i have the letter hereyes here it is reads 'they have press'd a power but it is not known whether for east or west the dearth is great the people mutinous and it is rumour'd cominius marcius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither 'tis bent most likely 'tis for you consider of it' first senator our army's in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us aufidius nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veil'd till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seem'd appear'd to rome by the discovery we shall be short'ned in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot second senator noble aufidius take your commission hie you to your bands let us alone to guard corioli if they set down before's for the remove bring up your army but i think you'll find th' have not prepar'd for us aufidius o doubt not that i speak from certainties nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward i leave your honours if we and caius marcius chance to meet 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more all the gods assist you aufidius and keep your honours safe first senator farewell second senator farewell all farewell exeunt scene iii rome marcius' house enter volumnia and virgilia mother and wife to marcius they set them down on two low stools and sew volumnia i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort if my son were my husband i should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love when yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding i considering how honour would become such a person- that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th' wall if renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where he was to find fame to a cruel war i sent him from whence he return'd his brows bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man virgilia but had he died in the business madam how then volumnia then his good report should have been my son i therein would have found issue hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen sons each in my love alike and none

to visit you virgilia beseech you give me leave to retire myself volumnia indeed you shall not methinks i hear hither your husband's drum see him pluck aufidius down by th' hair as children from a

troth i look'd upon him a wednesday half an hour together has such a confirm'd countenance i saw him run after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it he let it go again and after it again and over

marcius as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threat'ning th' other holding corioli in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will cominius where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches where is he call him hither marcius let him alone he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen the common file- a plague tribunes for them the mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they cominius but how prevail'd you marcius will the time serve to tell i do not think where is the enemy are you lords o' th' field if not why cease you till you are so cominius marcius we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose marcius how lies

of hope marcius i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by th' blood we have shed together by th' vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts we prove this very hour cominius though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to you yet dare i never deny your asking take your choice of those that best can aid your action marcius those are they that most are willing if any such be here- as it were sin to doubt- that love this painting wherein you see me smear'd if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country's dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow marcius they all shout and wave their swords take him up in their arms and cast up their caps o me alone make you a sword of me if

shall not be the grave of your deserving rome must know the value of her own 'twere a concealment worse than a theft no less than a traducement to hide your doings and to silence that which to the spire and top of praises vouch'd would seem but modest therefore i beseech you in sign of what you are not to reward what you have done before our army hear me marcius i have some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves rememb'red cominius should they not well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude and tent themselves with death of all the horses- whereof we have ta'en good and good

menenius not according to the prayer of the people for they love not marcius sicinius nature teaches beasts to know their friends menenius pray you who does the wolf love sicinius the lamb menenius ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius brutus he's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear menenius he's a bear indeed that lives fike a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you both tribunes well sir menenius in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance brutus he's poor in no one fault but stor'd with all sicinius especially in pride brutus and topping all others in boasting menenius this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city- i mean of us o' th' right-hand file do you both tribunes why how are we censur'd menenius because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry both tribunes well well sir well menenius why 'tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures- at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for being proud brutus we do it not alone sir menenius i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could both tribunes what then sir menenius why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates-alias fools- as any in rome sicinius menenius you are known well enough too menenius i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in't said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you are- i cannot call you lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cannot say your worships have deliver'd the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too brutus come sir come we know you well enough menenius you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a fosset-seller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinch'd with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber-pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones brutus come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol menenius our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's pack-saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen god-den to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you brutus and sicinius go aside enter volumnia virgilia and valeria how now my as fair as noble ladies- and the moon were she earthly no nobler- whither do you follow your eyes so fast volumnia honourable menenius my boy marcius approaches for the love of juno let's go menenius ha marcius coming home volumnia ay worthy menenius and with most prosperous approbation menenius take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo marcius coming home volumnia virgilia nay 'tis true volumnia look here's a letter from him the state hath another his wife another and i think there's one at home for you menenius i will make my very house reel to-night a letter for me virgilia yes certain there's a letter for you i saw't menenius a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years' health in which time i will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse-drench is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded virgilia o no no no volumnia o he is wounded i thank the gods for't menenius so do i too if it be not too much brings a victory in his pocket the wounds become him volumnia on's brows menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland menenius has he disciplin'd aufidius soundly volumnia titus lartius writes they fought together but aufidius got off menenius and 'twas time for him too i'll warrant him that an he had stay'd by him i would not have been so fidius'd for all the chests in corioli and the gold that's in them is the senate possess'd of this volumnia good ladies let's go yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly valeria in troth there's wondrous things spoke of him menenius wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing virgilia the gods grant them true volumnia true pow waw menenius true i'll be sworn they are true where is he wounded to the tribunes god save your good worships marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded volumnia i' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i' th' body menenius one i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- there's nine that i know volumnia he had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds upon him menenius now it's twenty-seven every gash was an enemy's grave a shout and flourish hark the trumpets volumnia these are the ushers of marcius before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears death that dark spirit in's nervy arm doth lie which being advanc'd declines and then men die a sennet trumpets sound enter cominius the general and titus lartius between them coriolanus crown'd with an oaken garland with captains and soldiers and a herald herald know rome that all alone marcius did fight within corioli gates where he hath won with fame a name to caius marcius these in honour follows coriolanus welcome to rome renowned coriolanus flourish all welcome to rome renowned coriolanus coriolanus no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more cominius look sir your mother coriolanus o you have i know petition'd all the gods for my prosperity kneels volumnia nay my good soldier up my gentle marcius worthy caius and by deed-achieving honour newly nam'd- what is it coriolanus must i can thee but o thy wife coriolanus my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laugh'd had i come coffin'd home that weep'st to see me triumph ah my dear such eyes the widows in corioli wear and mothers that lack sons menenius now the gods crown thee coriolanus and live you yet to valeria o my sweet lady pardon volumnia i know not where to turn o welcome home and welcome general and y'are welcome all menenius a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root on's heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crab trees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly cominius ever right coriolanus menenius ever ever herald give way there and go on coriolanus to his wife and mother your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have receiv'd not only greetings but with them change of honours volumnia i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only there's one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee coriolanus know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs cominius on to the capitol flourish cornets exeunt in state as before brutus and sicinius come forward brutus all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck clamb'ring the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges hors'd with variable complexions all agreeing in earnestness to see him seld-shown flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station our veil'd dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil of phoebus' burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture sicinius on the sudden i warrant him consul brutus then our office may during his power go sleep sicinius he cannot temp'rately transport his honours from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won brutus in that there's comfort sicinius doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to do't brutus i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i' th' market-place nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to th' people beg their stinking breaths sicinius 'tis right brutus it was his word o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles sicinius i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution brutus 'tis most like he will sicinius it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction brutus so it must fall out to him or our authorities for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that to's power he would have made them mules silenc'd their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in their war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them sicinius this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the people- which time shall not want if he be put upon't and that's as easy as to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him for ever enter a messenger brutus what's the matter messenger you are sent for to the capitol 'tis thought that marcius shall be consul i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended as to jove's statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts i never saw the like brutus let's to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for th' time but hearts for the event sicinius have with you exeunt scene ii rome the capitol enter two officers to lay cushions as it were in the capitol first officer come come they are almost here how many stand for consulships second officer three they say but 'tis thought of every one coriolanus will carry it first officer that's a brave fellow but he's vengeance proud and loves not the common people second officer faith there have been many great men that have flatter'd the people who ne'er loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't first officer if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to flatter them for their love second officer he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every car that heard it first officer no more of him he's a worthy man make way they are coming a sennet enter the patricians and the tribunes of the people lictors before them coriolanus menenius cominius the consul sicinius and brutus take their places by themselves coriolanus stands menenius having determin'd of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our after-meeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our well-found successes to report a little of that worthy work perform'd by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself coriolanus sits first senator speak good cominius leave nothing out for length and make us think rather our state's defective for requital than we to stretch it out masters o' th' people we do request your kindest ears and after your loving motion toward the common body to yield what passes here sicinius we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly brutus which the rather we shall be bless'd to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto priz'd them at menenius that's off that's off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak brutus most willingly but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it menenius he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow worthy cominius speak coriolanus rises and offers to go away nay keep your place first senator sit coriolanus never shame to hear what you have nobly done coriolanus your honours' pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them brutus sir i hope my words disbench'd you not coriolanus no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you sooth'd not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh- menenius pray now sit down coriolanus i had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monster'd exit menenius masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter- that's thousand to one good one- when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one on's ears to hear it proceed cominius cominius i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be utter'd feebly it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver if it be the man i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpois'd at sixteen years when tarquin made a head for rome he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator whom with all praise i point at saw him fight when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him he bestrid an o'erpress'd roman and i' th' consul's view slew three opposers tarquin's self he met and struck him on his knee in that day's feats when he might act the woman in the scene he prov'd best man i' th' field and for his meed was brow-bound with the oak his pupil age man-ent'red thus he waxed like a sea and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurch'd all swords of the garland for this last before and in corioli let me say i cannot speak him home he stopp'd the fliers and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail so men obey'd and fell below his stem his sword death's stamp where it did mark it took from face to foot he was a thing of blood whose every motion was tim'd with dying cries alone he ent'red the mortal gate of th' city which he painted with shunless destiny aidless came off and with a sudden re-enforcement struck corioli like a planet now all's his when by and by the din of war 'gan pierce his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate and to the battle came he where he did run reeking o'er the lives of men as if 'twere a perpetual spoil and till we call'd both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting menenius worthy man first senator he cannot but with measure fit the honours which we devise him cominius our spoils he kick'd at and look'd upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it menenius he's right noble let him be call'd for first senator call coriolanus officer he doth appear re-enter coriolanus menenius the senate coriolanus are well pleas'd to make thee consul coriolanus i do owe them still my life and services menenius it then remains that you do speak to the people coriolanus i do beseech you let me o'erleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing sicinius sir the people must have their voices neither will they bate one jot of ceremony menenius put them not to't pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honour with your form coriolanus it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people brutus mark you that coriolanus to brag unto them 'thus i did and thus' show them th' unaching scars which i should hide as if i had receiv'd them for the hire of their breath only menenius do not stand upon't we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour senators to coriolanus come all joy and honour flourish cornets then exeunt all but sicinius and brutus brutus you see how he intends to use the people sicinius may they perceive's intent he will require them as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give brutus come we'll inform them of our proceedings here on th' market-place i know they do attend us exeunt scene iii rome the forum enter seven or eight citizens first citizen once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him second citizen we may sir if we will third citizen we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members first citizen and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude third citizen we have been call'd so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our wits are so diversely colour'd and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o' th' compass second citizen think you so which way do you judge my wit would fly third citizen nay your wit will not so soon out as another man's will- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head but if it were at liberty 'twould sure southward second citizen why that way third citizen to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience' sake to help to get thee a wife second citizen you are never without your tricks you may you may third citizen are you all resolv'd to give your voices but that's no matter the greater part carries it i say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man enter coriolanus in a gown of humility with menenius here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his behaviour we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes he's to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and i'll direct you how you shall go by him all content content exeunt citizens menenius o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have done't coriolanus what must i say 'i pray sir'- plague upon't i cannot bring my tongue to such a pace 'look sir my wounds i got them in my country's service when some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran from th' noise of our own drums' menenius o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you coriolanus think upon me hang 'em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by 'em menenius you'll mar all i'll leave you pray you speak to 'em i pray you in wholesome manner exit re-enter three of the citizens coriolanus bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean so here comes a brace you know the cause sir of my standing here third citizen we do sir tell us what hath brought you to't coriolanus mine own desert second citizen your own desert coriolanus ay not mine own desire third citizen how not your own desire coriolanus no sir 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging third citizen you must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you coriolanus well then i pray your price o' th' consulship first citizen the price is to ask it kindly coriolanus kindly sir i pray let me ha't i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you second citizen you shall ha' it worthy sir coriolanus a match sir there's in all two worthy voices begg'd i have your alms adieu third citizen but this is something odd second citizen an 'twere to give again- but 'tis no matter exeunt the three citizens re-enter two other citizens coriolanus pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown fourth citizen you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly coriolanus your enigma fourth citizen you have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people coriolanus you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul fifth citizen we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily fourth citizen you have received many wounds for your country coriolanus i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther both citizens the gods give you joy sir heartily exeunt citizens coriolanus most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this wolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless vouches custom calls me to't what custom wills in all things should we do't the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heap'd for truth to o'erpeer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part suffered the other will i do re-enter three citizens more here come moe voices your voices for your voices i have fought watch'd for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul sixth citizen he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest man's voice seventh citizen therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people all amen amen god save thee noble consul exeunt citizens coriolanus worthy voices re-enter menenius with brutus and sicinius menenius you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the people's voice remains that in th' official marks invested you anon do meet the senate coriolanus is this done sicinius the custom of request you have discharg'd the people do admit you and are summon'd to meet anon upon your approbation coriolanus where at the senate house sicinius there coriolanus coriolanus may i change these garments sicinius you may sir coriolanus that i'll straight do and knowing myself again repair to th' senate house menenius i'll keep you company will you along brutus we stay here for the people sicinius fare you well exeunt coriolanus and menenius he has it now and by his looks methinks 'tis warm at's heart brutus with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds will you dismiss the people re-enter citizens sicinius how now my masters have you chose this man first citizen he has our voices sir brutus we pray the gods he may deserve your loves second citizen amen sir to my poor unworthy notice he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices third citizen certainly he flouted us downright first citizen no 'tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us second citizen not one amongst us save yourself but says he us'd us scornfully he should have show'd us his marks of merit wounds receiv'd for's country sicinius why so he did i am sure all no no no man saw 'em third citizen he said he had wounds which he could show in private and with his hat thus waving it in scorn 'i would be consul' says he 'aged custom but by your voices will not so permit me your voices therefore' when we granted that here was 'i thank you for your voices thank you your most sweet voices now you have left your voices i have no further with you' was not this mockery sicinius why either were you ignorant to see't or seeing it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices brutus could you not have told him- as you were lesson'd- when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i' th' body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o' th' state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to th' plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord sicinius thus to have said as you were fore-advis'd had touch'd his spirit and tried his inclination from him pluck'd either his gracious promise which you might as cause had call'd you up have held him to or else it would have gall'd his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught so putting him to rage you should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler and pass'd him unelected brutus did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush why had your bodies no heart among you or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment sicinius have you ere now denied the asker and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your su'd-for tongues third citizen he's not confirm'd we may deny him yet second citizens and will deny him i'll have five hundred voices of that sound first citizen i twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em brutus get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so sicinius let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scorn'd you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you th' apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you brutus lay a fault on us your tribunes that we labour'd no impediment between but that you must cast your election on him sicinius say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds pre-occupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us brutus ay spare us not say we read lectures to you how youngly he began to serve his country how long continued and what stock he springs of- the noble house o' th' marcians from whence came that ancus marcius numa's daughter's son who after great hostilius here was king of the same house publius and quintus were that our best water brought by conduits hither and censorinus nobly named so twice being by the people chosen censor was his great ancestor sicinius one thus descended that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that he's your fixed enemy and revoke your sudden approbation brutus say you ne'er had done't- harp on that still- but by our putting on and presently when you have drawn your number repair to th' capitol citizens will will so almost all repent in their election exeunt plebeians brutus let them go on this mutiny were better put in hazard than stay past doubt for greater if as his nature is he fall in rage with their refusal both observe and answer the vantage of his anger sicinius to th' capitol come we will be there before the stream o' th' people and this shall seem as partly 'tis their own which we have goaded onward exeunt act iii scene i rome a street cornets enter coriolanus menenius all the gentry cominius titus lartius and other senators coriolanus tullus aufidius then had made new head lartius he had my lord and that it was which caus'd our swifter composition coriolanus so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upon's again cominius they are worn lord consul so that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again coriolanus saw you aufidius lartius on safeguard he came to me and did curse against the volsces for they had so vilely yielded the town he is retir'd to antium coriolanus spoke he of me lartius he did my lord coriolanus how what lartius how often he had met you sword to sword that of all things upon the earth he hated your person most that he would pawn his fortunes to hopeless restitution so he might be call'd your vanquisher coriolanus at antium lives he lartius at antium coriolanus i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home enter sicinius and brutus behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o' th' common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance sicinius pass no further coriolanus ha what is that brutus it will be dangerous to go on- no further coriolanus what makes this change menenius the matter cominius hath he not pass'd the noble and the common brutus cominius no coriolanus have i had children's voices first senator tribunes give way he shall to th' market-place brutus the people are incens'd against him sicinius stop or all will fall in broil coriolanus are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on menenius be calm be calm coriolanus it is a purpos'd thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffer't and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be rul'd brutus call't not a plot the people cry you mock'd them and of late when corn was given them gratis you repin'd scandal'd the suppliants for the people call'd them time-pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness coriolanus why this was known before brutus not to them all coriolanus have you inform'd them sithence brutus how i inform them cominius you are like to do such business brutus not unlike each way to better yours coriolanus why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune sicinius you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound you must enquire your way which you are out of with a gentler spirit or never be so noble as a consul nor yoke with him for tribune menenius let's be calm cominius the people are abus'd set on this palt'ring becomes not rome nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely i' th' plain way of his merit coriolanus tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speak't again- menenius not now not now first senator not in this heat sir now coriolanus now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rank-scented meiny let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd and scatter'd by mingling them with us the honour'd number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars menenius well no more first senator no more words we beseech you coriolanus how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tetter us yet sought the very way to catch them brutus you speak o' th' people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity sicinius 'twere well we let the people know't menenius what what his choler coriolanus choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove 'twould be my mind sicinius it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further coriolanus shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute 'shall' cominius 'twas from the canon coriolanus 'shall' o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory 'shall' being but the horn and noise o' th' monster's wants not spirit to say he'll turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learn'd be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the great'st taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his 'shall' his popular 'shall' against a graver bench than ever frown'd in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take the one by th' other cominius well on to th' market-place coriolanus whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o' th' storehouse gratis as 'twas us'd sometime in greece- menenius well well no more of that coriolanus though there the people had more absolute pow'r- i say they nourish'd disobedience fed the ruin of the state brutus why shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice coriolanus i'll give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assur'd they ne'er did service for't being press'd to th' war even when the navel of the state was touch'd they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i' th' war their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd most valour spoke not for them th' accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the native of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bosom multiplied digest the senate's courtesy let deeds express what's like to be their words 'we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands' thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o' th' senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles menenius come enough brutus enough with over measure coriolanus no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance- it must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barr'd it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you- you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change on't that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that's sure of death without it- at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should become't not having the power to do the good it would for th' ill which doth control't brutus has said enough sicinius has spoken like a traitor and shall answer as traitors do coriolanus thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to the greater bench in a rebellion when what's not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i' th' dust brutus manifest treason sicinius this a consul no brutus the aediles ho enter an aedile let him be apprehended sicinius go call the people exit aedile in whose name myself attach thee as a traitorous innovator a foe to th' public weal obey i charge thee and follow to thine answer coriolanus hence old goat patricians we'll surety him cominius ag'd sir hands off coriolanus hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments sicinius help ye citizens enter a rabble of plebeians with the aediles menenius on both sides more respect sicinius here's he that would take from you all your power brutus seize him aediles plebeians down with him down with him second senator weapons weapons weapons they all bustle about coriolanus all tribunes patricians citizens what ho sicinius brutus coriolanus citizens patricians peace peace peace stay hold peace menenius what is about to be i am out of breath confusion's near i cannot speak you tribunes to th' people- coriolanus patience speak good sicinius sicinius hear me people peace plebeians let's hear our tribune peace speak speak speak sicinius you are at point to lose your liberties marcius would have all from you marcius whom late you have nam'd for consul menenius fie fie fie this is the way to kindle not to quench first senator to unbuild the city and to lay all flat sicinius what is the city but the people plebeians true the people are the city brutus by the consent of all we were establish'd the people's magistrates plebeians you so remain menenius and so are like to do cominius that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin sicinius this deserves death brutus or let us stand to our authority or let us lose it we do here pronounce upon the part o' th' people in whose power we were elected theirs marcius is worthy of present death sicinius therefore lay hold of him bear him to th' rock tarpeian and from thence into destruction cast him brutus aediles seize him plebeians yield marcius yield menenius hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word aediles peace peace menenius be that you seem truly your country's friend and temp'rately proceed to what you would thus violently redress brutus sir those cold ways that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous where the disease is violent lay hands upon him and bear him to the rock coriolanus draws his sword coriolanus no i'll die here there's some among you have beheld me fighting come try upon yourselves what you have seen me menenius down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile brutus lay hands upon him menenius help marcius help you that be noble help him young and old plebeians down with him down with him in this mutiny the tribunes the aediles and the people are beat in menenius go get you to your house be gone away all will be nought else second senator get you gone coriolanus stand fast we have as many friends as enemies menenius shall it be put to that first senator the gods forbid i prithee noble friend home to thy house leave us to cure this cause menenius for 'tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you cominius come sir along with us coriolanus i would they were barbarians as they are though in rome litter'd not romans as they are not though calved i' th' porch o' th' capitol menenius be gone put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another coriolanus on fair ground i could beat forty of them menenius i could myself take up a brace o' th' best of them yea the two tribunes cominius but now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic and manhood is call'd foolery when it stands against a falling fabric will you hence before the tag return whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and o'erbear what they are us'd to bear menenius pray you be gone i'll try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patch'd with cloth of any colour cominius nay come away exeunt coriolanus and cominius with others patricians this man has marr'd his fortune menenius his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove for's power to thunder his heart's his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death a noise within here's goodly work patricians i would they were a-bed menenius i would they were in tiber what the vengeance could he not speak 'em fair re-enter brutus and sicinius the rabble again sicinius where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself menenius you worthy tribunes- sicinius he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at nought first citizen he shall well know the noble tribunes are the people's mouths and we their hands plebeians he shall sure on't menenius sir sir- sicinius peace menenius do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant sicinius sir how comes't that you have holp to make this rescue menenius hear me speak as i do know the consul's worthiness so can i name his faults sicinius consul what consul menenius the consul coriolanus brutus he consul plebeians no no no no no menenius if by the tribunes' leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time sicinius speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies to-night menenius now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enroll'd in jove's own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own sicinius he's a disease that must be cut away menenius o he's a limb that has but a disease- mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome that's worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost- which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ounce- he dropt it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that do't and suffer it a brand to th' end o' th' world sicinius this is clean kam brutus merely awry when he did love his country it honour'd him sicinius the service of the foot being once gangren'd is not then respected for what before it was brutus we'll hear no more pursue him to his house and pluck him thence lest his infection being of catching nature spread further menenius one word more one word this tiger-footed rage when it shall find the harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds to's heels proceed by process lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out and sack great rome with romans brutus if it were so- sicinius what do ye talk have we not had a taste of his obedience- our aediles smote ourselves resisted come menenius consider this he has been bred i' th' wars since 'a could draw a sword and is ill school'd in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave i'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril first senator noble tribunes it is the humane way the other course will prove too bloody and the end of it unknown to the beginning sicinius noble menenius be you then as the people's officer masters lay down your weapons brutus go not home sicinius meet on the market-place we'll attend you there where if you bring not marcius we'll proceed in our first way menenius i'll bring him to you to the senators let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow first senator pray you let's to him exeunt scene ii rome the house of coriolanus enter coriolanus with nobles coriolanus let them pull all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them first patrician you do the nobler coriolanus i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woollen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war enter volumnia i talk of you why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am volumnia o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out coriolanus let go volumnia you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd ere they lack'd power to cross you coriolanus let them hang volumnia ay and burn too enter menenius with the senators menenius come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it first senator there's no remedy unless by not so doing our good city cleave in the midst and perish volumnia pray be counsell'd i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage menenius well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to th' herd but that the violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armour on which i can scarcely bear coriolanus what must i do menenius return to th' tribunes coriolanus well what then what then menenius repent what you have spoke coriolanus for them i cannot do it to the gods must i then do't to them volumnia you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honour and policy like unsever'd friends i' th' war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by th' other lose that they combine not there coriolanus tush tush menenius a good demand volumnia if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request coriolanus why force you this volumnia because that now it lies you on to speak to th' people not by your own instruction nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but roted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd i should do so in honour i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin menenius noble lady come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the los of what is past volumnia i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretch'd it- here be with them- thy knee bussing the stones- for in such busines action is eloquence and the eyes of th' ignorant more learned than the ears- waving thy head which often thus correcting thy-stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person menenius this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being ask'd as free as words to little purpose volumnia prithee now go and be rul'd although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower enter cominius here is cominius cominius i have been i' th' market-place and sir 'tis fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence all's in anger menenius only fair speech cominius i think 'twill serve if he can thereto frame his spirit volumnia he must and will prithee now say you will and go about it coriolanus must i go show them my unbarb'd sconce must i with my base tongue give to my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will do't yet were there but this single plot to lose this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it and throw't against the wind to th' market-place you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to th' life cominius come come we'll prompt you volumnia i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier so to have my praise for this perform a part thou hast not done before coriolanus well i must do't away my disposition and possess me some harlot's spirit my throat of war be turn'd which quier'd with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggar's tongue make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees who bow'd but in my

say 'it shall be so i' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if i say fine cry 'fine'- if death cry 'death' insisting on the old prerogative and power i' th' truth o' th' cause aedile i shall inform them brutus and when such time they have begun to cry let them not cease but with a din confus'd enforce the present execution of

content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be prov'd upon you coriolanus i am content menenius lo citizens he says he is content the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i' th' holy churchyard coriolanus scratches with briers scars to move laughter only menenius consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you cominius well well no more coriolanus what is the matter that being pass'd for consul with full voice i am so dishonour'd that the very hour you take it off again sicinius answer to us coriolanus say then 'tis true i ought so sicinius we charge you that you have contriv'd to take from rome all season'd office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people coriolanus how- traitor menenius nay temperately your promise

put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him-

coriolanus you menenius is this the promise that you made your mother cominius know i pray you- coriolanus i'll know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile flaying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor check my courage for what they can give to have't with saying 'good morrow' sicinius for that he has- as much as in him lies- from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that do distribute it- in the name o' th' people and in the power of us the tribunes we ev'n from this instant banish him our city in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never

friends- sicinius he's sentenc'd no more hearing cominius let me speak i have been consul and can show for rome her enemies' marks upon me i do love my country's good with a respect more tender more holy and profound than mine own life my dear wife's estimate her womb's increase and treasure of my loins then if i would speak that- sicinius we know your drift speak what brutus there's no more to be said but he is banish'd as enemy to the people and his country it shall be so plebeians it shall be so it shall be so coriolanus you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o' th' rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air- i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumour shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance- which finds not till it feels making but reservation of yourselves still your

unmuffling if tullus not yet thou know'st me and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself aufidius what is thy name coriolanus a name unmusical to the volscians' ears and harsh in sound to thine aufidius say what's thy name thou has a grim appearance and thy face bears a command in't though thy tackle's torn thou show'st a noble vessel what's thy name coriolanus prepare thy brow to frown- know'st thou me yet aufidius i know thee not thy name coriolanus my name is caius marcius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname- a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest an suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be whoop'd out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope mistake me not to save my life for if i had fear'd death of all the men i' th' world i would have 'voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my cank'red country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes th'art tir'd then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followed thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service aufidius o marcius marcius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say ''tis true' i'd not believe them more than thee all noble marcius let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarr'd the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour know thou first i lov'd the maid i married never man sigh'd truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell the we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm for't thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me- we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat- and wak'd half dead with nothing worthy marcius had we no other quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banish'd we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood o'erbeat o come go in and take our friendly senators by th' hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepar'd against your territories though not for rome itself coriolanus you bless me gods aufidius therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take th' one half of my commission and set down- as best thou art experienc'd since thou know'st thy country's strength and weakness- thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes and more a friend than e'er an enemy yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome exeunt coriolanus and aufidius the two servingmen come forward first servant here's a strange alteration second servant by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him first servant what an arm he has he turn'd me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top second servant nay i knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methought- i cannot tell how to term it first servant he had so looking as it were- would i were hang'd but i thought there was more in him than i could think second servant so did i i'll be sworn he is simply the rarest man i' th' world first servant i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on second servant who my master first servant nay it's no matter for that second servant worth six on him first servant nay not so neither but i take him to be the greater soldier second servant faith look you one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellent first servant ay and for an assault too re-enter the third servingman third servant o slaves i can tell you news- news you rascals both what what what let's partake third servant i would not be a roman of all nations i had as lief be a condemn'd man both wherefore wherefore third servant why here's he that was wont to thwack our general- caius marcius first servant why do you say 'thwack our general' third servant i do not say 'thwack our general' but he was always good enough for him second servant come we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him i have heard him say so himself first servant he was too hard for him directly to say the troth on't before corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a carbonado second servant an he had been cannibally given he might have broil'd and eaten him too first servant but more of thy news third servant why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to mars set at upper end o' th' table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with's hand and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse but the bottom of the news is our general is cut i' th' middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table he'll go he says and sowl the porter of rome gates by th' ears he will mow all down before him and leave his passage poll'd second servant and he's as like to do't as any man i can imagine third servant do't he will do't for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not- look you sir- show themselves as we term it his friends whilst he's in directitude first servant directitude what's that third servant but when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel an with him first servant but when goes this forward third servant to-morrow to-day presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon 'tis as it were parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips second servant why then we shall have a stirring world again this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed ballad-makers first servant let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as day does night it's spritely waking audible and full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mull'd deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men second servant 'tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds first servant ay and it makes men hate one another third servant reason because they then less need one another the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians they are rising they are rising both in in in in exeunt scene vi rome a public place enter the two tribunes sicinius and brutus sicinius we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer by't behold dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see our tradesmen singing in their shops and going about their functions friendly enter menenius brutus we stood to't in good time is this menenius sicinius 'tis he 'tis he o he is grown most kind of late hail sir menenius hail to you both sicinius your coriolanus is not much miss'd but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were he more angry at it menenius all's well and might have been much better he could have temporiz'd sicinius where is he hear you menenius nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him enter three or four citizens citizens the gods preserve you both sicinius god-den our neighbours brutus god-den to you all god-den to you an first citizen ourselves our wives and children on our knees are bound to pray for you both sicinius live and thrive brutus farewell kind neighbours we wish'd coriolanus had lov'd you as we did citizens now the gods keep you both tribunes farewell farewell exeunt citizens sicinius this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion brutus caius marcius was a worthy officer i' the war but insolent o'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking self-loving- sicinius and affecting one sole throne without assistance menenius i think not so sicinius we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so brutus the gods have well prevented it and rome sits safe and still without him enter an aedile aedile worthy tribunes there is a slave whom we have put in prison reports the volsces with several powers are ent'red in the roman territories and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before 'em menenius 'tis aufidius who hearing of our marcius' banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshell'd when marcius stood for rome and durst not once peep out sicinius come what talk you of marcius brutus go see this rumourer whipp'd it cannot be the volsces dare break with us menenius cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like hath been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded sicinius tell not me i know this cannot be brutus not possible enter a messenger messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the senate house some news is come that turns their countenances sicinius 'tis this slave- go whip him fore the people's eyes- his raising nothing but his report messenger yes worthy sir the slave's report is seconded and more more fearful is deliver'd sicinius what more fearful messenger it is spoke freely out of many mouths- how probable i do not know- that marcius join'd with aufidius leads a power 'gainst rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the young'st and oldest thing sicinius this is most likely brutus rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again sicinius the very trick on 't menenius this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violent'st contrariety enter a second messenger second messenger you are sent for to the senate a fearful army led by caius marcius associated with aufidius rages upon our territories and have already o'erborne their way consum'd with fire and took what lay before them enter cominius cominius o you have made good work menenius what news what news cominius you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates to see your wives dishonour'd to your noses- menenius what's the news what's the news cominius your temples burned in their cement and your franchises whereon you stood confin'd into an auger's bore menenius pray now your news you have made fair work i fear me pray your news if marcius should be join'd wi' th' volscians- cominius if he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature that shapes man better and they follow him against us brats with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies menenius you have made good work you and your apron men you that stood so much upon the voice of occupation and the breath of garlic-eaters cominius he'll shake your rome about your ears menenius as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work brutus but is this true sir cominius ay and you'll look pale before you find it other all the regions do smilingly revolt and who resists are mock'd for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools who is't can blame him your enemies and his find something in him menenius we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy cominius who shall ask it the tribunes cannot do't for shame the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends if they should say 'be good to rome'- they charg'd him even as those should do that had deserv'd his hate and therein show'd fike enemies menenius 'tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say 'beseech you cease' you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair cominius you have brought a trembling upon rome such as was never s' incapable of help both tribunes say not we brought it menenius how was't we we lov'd him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o' th' city cominius but i fear they'll roar him in again tullus aufidius the second name of men obeys his points as if he were his officer desperation is all the policy strength and defence that rome can make against them enter a troop of citizens menenius here comes the clusters and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus' exile now he's coming and not a hair upon a soldier's head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices 'tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserv'd it plebeians faith we hear fearful news first citizen for mine own part when i said banish him i said 'twas pity second citizen and so did i third citizen and so did i and to say the truth so did very many of us that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will cominius y'are goodly things you voices menenius you have made good work you and your cry shall's to the capitol cominius o ay what else exeunt cominius and menenius sicinius go masters get you be not dismay'd these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear go home and show no sign of fear first citizen the gods be good to us come masters let's home i ever said we were i' th' wrong when we banish'd him second citizen so did we all but come let's home exeunt citizens brutus i do not like this news sicinius nor i brutus let's to the capitol would half my wealth would buy this for a lie sicinius pray let's go exeunt scene vii a camp at a short distance from rome enter aufidius with his lieutenant aufidius do they still fly to th' roman lieutenant i do not know what witchcraft's in him but your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat their talk at table and their thanks at end and you are dark'ned in this action sir even by your own aufidius i cannot help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in that's no changeling and i must excuse what cannot be amended lieutenant yet i wish sir- i mean for your particular- you had not join'd in commission with him but either had borne the action of yourself or else to him had left it solely aufidius i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to th' vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragon-like and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine whene'er we come to our account lieutenant sir i beseech you think you he'll carry rome aufidius all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence i think he'll be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honours even whether 'twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from th' casque to th' cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controll'd the war but one of these- as he hath spices of them all- not all for i dare so far free him- made him fear'd so hated and so banish'd but he has a merit to choke it in the utt'rance so our virtues lie in th' interpretation of the time and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a chair t' extol what it hath done one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail come let's away when caius rome is thine thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine exeunt this electronic version of the complete works of william shakespeare is copyright

scene i rome a public place enter menenius cominius sicinius and brutus the two tribunes with others menenius no i'll not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who lov'd him in a most dear particular he call'd me father but what o' that go you that banish'd him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coy'd to hear cominius speak i'll keep at home cominius he would not seem to know me menenius do you hear cominius yet one time he did call me by my name i urg'd our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together 'coriolanus' he would not answer to forbid all names he was a kind of nothing titleless till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire of burning rome menenius why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for rome to make coals cheap- a noble memory cominius i minded him how royal 'twas to pardon when it was less expected he replied it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punish'd menenius very well could he say less cominius i offer'd to awaken his regard for's private friends his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff he said 'twas folly for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt and still to nose th' offence menenius for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too- we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you sicinius nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid in this so never-needed help yet do not upbraid's with our distress but sure if you would be your country's pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman menenius no i'll not meddle sicinius pray you go to him menenius what should i do brutus only make trial what your love can do for rome towards marcius menenius well and say that marcius return me as cominius is return'd unheard- what then but as a discontented friend grief-shot with his unkindness say't be so sicinius yet your good will must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well menenius i'll undertake't i think he'll hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not din'd the veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd these pipes and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priest-like fasts therefore i'll watch him till he be dieted to my request and then i'll set upon him brutus you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way menenius good faith i'll prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success exit cominius he'll never hear him sicinius not cominius i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as 'twould burn rome and his injury the gaoler to his pity i kneel'd before him 'twas very faintly he said 'rise' dismiss'd me thus with his speechless hand what he would do he sent in writing after me what he would not bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain unless his noble mother and his wife who as i hear mean to solicit him for mercy to his country therefore let's hence and with our fair entreaties haste them on exeunt scene ii the volscian camp before rome enter menenius to the watch on guard first watch stay whence are you second watch stand and go back menenius you guard like men 'tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus first watch from whence menenius from rome first watch you may not pass you must return our general will no more hear from thence second watch you'll see your rome embrac'd with fire before you'll speak with coriolanus menenius good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touch'd your ears it is menenius first watch be it so go back the virtue of your name is not here passable menenius i tell thee fellow thy general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his fame unparallel'd haply amplified for i have ever verified my friends- of whom he's chief- with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stamp'd the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass first watch faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely therefore go back menenius prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general second watch howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have i am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass therefore go back menenius has he din'd canst thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner first watch you are a roman are you menenius i am as thy general is first watch then you should hate rome as he does can you when you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this no you are deceiv'd therefore back to rome and prepare for your execution you are condemn'd our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon menenius sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation first watch come my captain knows you not menenius i mean thy general first watch my general cares not for you back i say go lest i let forth your half pint of blood back- that's the utmost of your having back menenius nay but fellow fellow- enter coriolanus with aufidius coriolanus what's the matter menenius now you companion i'll say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what's to come upon thee the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to thee coriolanus away menenius how away coriolanus wife mother child i know not my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much therefore be gone mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force yet for i lov'd thee take this along i writ it for thy sake gives a letter and would have sent it another word menenius i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius was my belov'd in rome yet thou behold'st aufidius you keep a constant temper exeunt coriolanus and aufidius first watch now sir is your name menenius second watch 'tis a spell you see of much power you know the way home again first watch do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back second watch what cause do you think i have to swoon menenius i neither care for th' world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think there's any y'are so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was said to away exit first watch a noble fellow i warrant him second watch the worthy fellow is our general he's the rock the oak not to be wind-shaken exeunt scene iii the tent of coriolanus enter coriolanus aufidius and others coriolanus we will before the walls of rome to-morrow set down our host my partner in this action you must report to th' volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business aufidius only their ends you have respected stopp'd your ears against the general suit of rome never admitted a private whisper- no not with such friends that thought them sure of you coriolanus this last old man whom with crack'd heart i have sent to rome lov'd me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have- though i show'd sourly to him- once more offer'd the first conditions which they did refuse and cannot now accept to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to shout within ha what shout is this shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time 'tis made i will not enter in mourning habits virgilia volumnia valeria young marcius with attendants my wife comes foremost then the honour'd mould wherein this trunk was fram'd and in her hand the grandchild to her blood but out affection all bond and privilege of nature break let it be virtuous to be obstinate what is that curtsy worth or those doves' eyes which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not of stronger earth than others my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries 'deny not' let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy i'll never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin virgilia my lord and husband coriolanus these eyes are not the same i wore in rome virgilia the sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd makes you think so coriolanus like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that 'forgive our romans' o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgin'd it e'er since you gods i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink my knee i' th' earth kneels of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons volumnia o stand up blest whilst with no softer cushion than the flint i kneel before thee and unproperly show duty as mistaken all this while between the child and parent kneels coriolanus what's this your knees to me to your corrected son then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun murd'ring impossibility to make what cannot be slight work volumnia thou art my warrior i holp to frame thee do you know this lady coriolanus the noble sister of publicola the moon of rome chaste as the icicle that's curdied by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dian's temple- dear valeria volumnia this is a poor epitome of yours which by th' interpretation of full time may show like all yourself coriolanus the god of soldiers with the consent of supreme jove inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable and stick i' th' wars like a great sea-mark standing every flaw and saving those that eye thee volumnia your knee sirrah coriolanus that's my brave boy volumnia even he your wife this lady and myself are suitors to you coriolanus i beseech you peace or if you'd ask remember this before the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with rome's mechanics tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not t'allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons volumnia o no more no more you have said you will not grant us any thing- for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us coriolanus aufidius and you volsces mark for we'll hear nought from rome in private your request volumnia should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out and to poor we thine enmity's most capital thou bar'st us our prayers to the gods which is a comfort that all but we enjoy for how can we alas how can we for our country pray whereto we are bound together with thy victory whereto we are bound alack or we must lose the country our dear nurse or else thy person our comfort in the country we must find an evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles through our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i can not persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread- trust to't thou shalt not- on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world virgilia ay and mine that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time boy 'a shall not tread on me i'll run away till i am bigger but then i'll fight coriolanus not of a woman's tenderness to be requires nor child nor woman's face to see i have sat too long rising volumnia nay go not from us thus if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us as poisonous of your honour no our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say 'this mercy we have show'd' the romans 'this we receiv'd' and each in either side give the all-hail to thee and cry 'be blest for making up this peace' thou know'st great son the end of war's uncertain but this certain that if thou conquer rome the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses whose chronicle thus writ 'the man was noble but with his last attempt he wip'd it out destroy'd his country and his name remains to th' ensuing age abhorr'd' speak to me son thou hast affected the fine strains of honour to imitate the graces of the gods to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak why dost not speak think'st thou it honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs daughter speak you he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons there's no man in the world more bound to's mother yet here he lets me prate like one i' th' stocks thou hast never in thy life show'd thy dear mother any courtesy when she poor hen fond of no second brood has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home loaden with honour say my request's unjust and spurn me back but if it he not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee that thou restrain'st from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs he turns away down ladies let us shame him with our knees to his surname coriolanus 'longs more pride than pity to our prayers down an end this is the last so we will home to rome and die among our neighbours nay behold's this boy that cannot tell what he would have but kneels and holds up hands for fellowship does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny't come let us go this fellow had a volscian to his mother his wife is in corioli and his child like him by chance yet give us our dispatch i am hush'd until our city be afire and then i'll speak a little he holds her by the hand silent coriolanus o mother mother what have you done behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at o my mother mother o you have won a happy victory to rome but for your son- believe it o believe it- most dangerously you have with him prevail'd if not most mortal to him but let it come aufidius though i cannot make true wars i'll frame convenient peace now good aufidius were you in my stead would you have heard a mother less or granted less aufidius aufidius i was mov'd withal coriolanus i dare be sworn you were and sir it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir what peace you'fl make advise me for my part i'll not to rome i'll back with you and pray you stand to me in this cause o mother wife aufidius aside i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour at difference in thee out of that i'll work myself a former fortune coriolanus to the ladies ay by and by but we will drink together and you shall bear a better witness back than words which we on like conditions will have counter-seal'd come enter with us ladies you deserve to have a temple built you all the swords in italy and her confederate arms could not have made this peace exeunt scene iv rome a public place enter menenius and sicinius menenius see you yond coign o' th' capitol yond cornerstone sicinius why what of that menenius if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his mother may prevail with him but i say there is no hope in't our throats are sentenc'd and stay upon execution sicinius is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man menenius there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub this marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he's more than a creeping thing sicinius he lov'd his mother dearly menenius so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander what he bids be done is finish'd with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in sicinius yes- mercy if you report him truly menenius i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is 'long of you sicinius the gods be good unto us menenius no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us when we banish'd him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us enter a messenger messenger sir if you'd save your life fly to your house the plebeians have got your fellow tribune and hale him up and down all swearing if the roman ladies bring not comfort home they'll give him death by inches enter another messenger sicinius what's the news second messenger good news good news the ladies have prevail'd the volscians are dislodg'd and marcius gone a merrier day did never yet greet rome no not th' expulsion of the tarquins sicinius friend art thou certain this is true is't most certain second messenger as certain as i know the sun is fire where have you lurk'd that you make doubt of it ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide as the recomforted through th' gates why hark you trumpets hautboys drums beat all together the trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes tabors and cymbals and the shouting romans make the sun dance hark you a shout within menenius this is good news i will go meet the ladies this volumnia is worth of consuls senators patricians a city full of tribunes such as you a sea and land full you have pray'd well to-day this morning for ten thousand of your throats i'd not have given a doit hark how they joy sound still with the shouts sicinius first the gods bless you for your tidings next accept my thankfulness second messenger sir we have all great cause to give great thanks sicinius they are near the city messenger almost at point to enter sicinius we'll meet them and help the joy exeunt scene v rome a street near the gate enter two senators with volumnia virgilia valeria passing over the stage 'with other lords first senator behold our patroness the life of rome call all your tribes together praise the gods and make triumphant fires strew flowers before them unshout the noise that banish'd marcius repeal him with the welcome of his mother all welcome ladies welcome a flourish with drums and trumpets exeunt scene vi corioli a public place enter tullus aufidius with attendents aufidius go tell the lords o' th' city i am here deliver them this paper' having read it bid them repair to th' market-place where i even in theirs and in the commons' ears will vouch the truth of it him i accuse the city ports by this hath enter'd and intends t' appear before the people hoping to purge himself with words dispatch exeunt attendants enter three or four conspirators of aufidius' faction most welcome first conspirator how is it with our general aufidius even so as with a man by his own alms empoison'd and with his charity slain second conspirator most noble sir if you do hold the same intent wherein you wish'd us parties we'll deliver you of your great danger aufidius sir i cannot tell we must proceed as we do find the people third conspirator the people will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all aufidius i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction i rais'd him and i pawn'd mine honour for his truth who being so heighten'd he watered his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends and to this end he bow'd his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free third conspirator sir his stoutness when he did stand for consul which he lost by lack of stooping- aufidius that i would have spoken of being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat i took him made him joint-servant with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men serv'd his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong till at the last i seem'd his follower not partner and he wag'd me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary first conspirator so he did my lord the army marvell'd at it and in the last when he had carried rome and that we look'd for no less spoil than glory- aufidius there was it for which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him at a few drops of women's rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour of our great action therefore shall he die and i'll renew me in his fall but hark drums and trumpets sound with great shouts of the people first conspirator your native town you enter'd like a post and had no welcomes home but he returns splitting the air with noise second conspirator and patient fools whose children he hath slain their base throats tear with giving him glory third conspirator therefore at your vantage ere he express himself or move the people with what he would say let him feel your sword which we will second when he lies along after your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury his reasons with his body aufidius say no more here come the lords enter the lords of the city lords you are most welcome home aufidius i have not deserv'd it but worthy lords have you with heed perused what i have written to you lords we have first lord and grieve to hear't what faults he made before the last i think might have found easy fines but there to end where he was to begin and give away the benefit of our levies answering us with our own charge making a treaty where there was a yielding- this admits no excuse aufidius he approaches you shall hear him enter coriolanus marching with drum and colours the commoners being with him coriolanus hail lords i am return'd your soldier no more infected with my country's love than when i parted hence but still subsisting under your great command you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home doth more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action we have made peace with no less honour to the antiates than shame to th' romans and we here deliver subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians together with the seal o' th' senate what we have compounded on aufidius read it not noble lords but tell the traitor in the highest degree he hath abus'd your powers coriolanus traitor how now aufidius ay traitor marcius coriolanus marcius aufidius ay marcius caius marcius dost thou think i'll grace thee with that robbery thy stol'n name coriolanus in corioli you lords and heads o' th' state perfidiously he has betray'd your business and given up for certain drops of salt your city rome- i say your city- to his wife and mother breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten

spake to thee pisanio it was his queen his queen imogen then wav'd his handkerchief pisanio and kiss'd it madam imogen senseless linen happier therein than i and that was all pisanio no madam for so long as he could make me with his eye or care distinguish him from others he did keep the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief still waving as the fits and stirs of's mind could best express how slow his soul sail'd on how swift his ship imogen thou shouldst have made him as little as a crow or less ere left to after-eye him pisanio madam so i did imogen i would have broke mine eyestrings crack'd them but to look upon him till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle nay followed him till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turn'd mine eye and wept but good pisanio when shall we hear from him pisanio be assur'd madam with his next vantage imogen i did not take my leave of him but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honour or have charg'd him at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight t' encounter me with orisons for then i am in heaven for him or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words comes in my father and like the tyrannous breathing of the north shakes all our buds from growing enter a lady lady the queen madam desires your highness' company imogen those things i bid you do get them dispatch'd i will attend the queen pisanio madam i shall exeunt scene iv rome philario's house enter philario iachimo a frenchman a dutchman and a spaniard iachimo believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of but i could then have look'd on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items philario you speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he is with that which makes him both without and within frenchman i have seen him in france we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he iachimo this matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter frenchman and then his banishment iachimo ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality but how comes it he is to sojourn with you how creeps acquaintance philario his father and i were soldiers together to whom i have been often bound for no less than my life enter posthumus here comes the briton let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality i beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing frenchman sir we have known together in orleans posthumus since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still frenchman sir you o'errate my poor kindness i was glad i did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature posthumus by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller rather shunn'd to go even with what i heard than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences but upon my mended judgment- if i offend not to say it is mended- my quarrel was not altogether slight frenchman faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fall'n both iachimo can we with manners ask what was the difference frenchman safely i think 'twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report it was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching- and upon warrant of bloody affirmation- his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france iachimo that lady is not now living or this gentleman's opinion by this worn out posthumus she holds her virtue still and i my mind iachimo you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy posthumus being so far provok'd as i was in france i would abate her nothing though i profess myself her adorer not her friend iachimo as fair and as good- a kind of hand-in-hand comparison- had been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain if she went before others i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many i have beheld i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady posthumus i prais'd her as i rated her so do i my stone iachimo what do you esteem it at posthumus more than the world enjoys iachimo either your unparagon'd mistress is dead or she's outpriz'd by a trifle posthumus you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods iachimo which the gods have given you posthumus which by their graces i will keep iachimo you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your ring may be stol'n too so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a that-way-accomplish'd courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last posthumus your italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail i do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding i fear not my ring philario let us leave here gentlemen posthumus sir with all my heart this worthy signior i thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first iachimo with five times so much conversation i should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend posthumus no no iachimo i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too i durst attempt it against any lady in the world posthumus you are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt iachimo what's that posthumus a repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more- a punishment too philario gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and i pray you be better acquainted iachimo would i had put my estate and my neighbour's on th' approbation of what i have spoke posthumus what lady would you choose to assail iachimo yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd posthumus i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring i hold dear as my finger 'tis part of it iachimo you are a friend and therein the wiser if you buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you that you fear posthumus this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose i hope iachimo i am the master of my speeches and would undergo what's spoken i swear posthumus will you i shall but lend my diamond till your return let there be covenants drawn between's my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here's my ring philario i will have it no lay iachimo by the gods it is one if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if i come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours- provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment posthumus i embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd i am no further your enemy- she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduc'd you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword iachimo your hand- a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded posthumus agreed exeunt posthumus and iachimo frenchman will this hold think you philario signior iachimo will not from it pray let us follow 'em exeunt scene v britain cymbeline's palace enter queen ladies and cornelius queen whiles yet the dew's on ground gather those flowers make haste who has the note of them lady i madam queen dispatch exeunt ladies now master doctor have you brought those drugs cornelius pleaseth your highness ay here they are madam presenting a box but i beseech your grace without offence- my conscience bids me ask- wherefore you have commanded of me these most poisonous compounds which are the movers of a languishing death but though slow deadly queen i wonder doctor thou ask'st me such a question have i not been thy pupil long hast thou not learn'd me how to make perfumes distil preserve yea so that our great king himself doth woo me oft for my confections having thus far proceeded- unless thou think'st me devilish- is't not meet that i did amplify my judgment in other conclusions i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging- but none human- to try the vigour of them and apply allayments to their act and by them gather their several virtues and effects cornelius your highness shall from this practice but make hard your heart besides the seeing these effects will be both noisome and infectious queen o content thee enter pisanio aside here comes a flattering rascal upon him will i first work he's for his master an enemy to my son- how now pisanio doctor your service for this time is ended take your own way cornelius aside i do suspect you madam but you shall do no harm queen to pisanio hark thee a word cornelius aside i do not like her she doth think she has strange ling'ring poisons i do know her spirit and will not trust one of her malice with a drug of such damn'd nature those she has will stupefy and dull the sense awhile which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs then afterward up higher but there is no danger in what show of death it makes more than the locking up the spirits a time
